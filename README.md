TEI description for HSP's Historical Images, New Technologies (HINT) Digital History Project.

The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit, featuring TEI-encoded political cartoons, that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program. Additional support provided by The Richard Lounsbery Foundation.
