                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit, featuring 500 encoded political cartoons, that will
                    demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and
                    contextual materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in
                    new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the National Historical

  <note type="biography">Chester Alan Arthur was a United States Vice President and President.  He was born on October 5, 1829 in Fairfield, Vermont and was the son of an Irish immigrant.  He graduated from Union College in New York in 1848, taught secondary school in Vermont and New York, and later became a lawyer in New York City.  During the Civil War he served as Quartermaster General of the State of New York.  After the War, Arthur rose within the ranks of the Republican Party because of his allegiance to Roscoe Conkling, a New York Senator and head of the Stalwart political machine.  In 1871 President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Arthur to serve as Collector of the New York Customhouse.  In 1878 President Rutherford B. Hayes sought to reform the party and to end the practice of political patronage and so, he fired Arthur and accused the Customhouse of political corruption and patronage.   Two years later, the Republicans, seeking to gain support of the Stalwarts, nominated Arthur as James A. Garfield’s running mate.  After President Garfield was assassinated in 1881, Arthur became president, broke ties with Stalwarts, and began to enact civil service reform.  On January 18, 1883, Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act which ensured federal employees they would be hired based on merit and not party loyalty.   As President, Arthur worked to modernize the United States Navy and invested in the construction of steam-powered engines.  He also supported lower tariffs and signed the Tariff Act of 1883.
During Arthur’s Administration, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was enacted.  It denied citizenship to Chinese immigrants and banned them from entering the United States.  The law was finally repealed in 1943.  During his presidency, Arthur became ill with kidney disease and lost the Republican nomination for the 1884 election to James Blaine.  He died on November 18, 1886.

Garfield Administrations and was the 31st Speaker of the US House of Representatives.  Blaine graduated from Washington College in 1847 and became a newspaper editor in Augusta, Maine.  In 1859 he was elected to serve in the Maine House of Representatives and later, in 1862, successfully ran for the US Congress.  In 1880 he lost the Republican Presidential nomination to James A. Garfield and, after the election, chosen to serve as Secretary of State.  Four years later Republicans nominated him as their candidate, but he narrowly lost the presidential election to Grover Cleveland.  In 1888, Benjamin Harrison appointed him Secretary of State.  As Secretary of State, Blaine expanded trade with Latin America and served as chairman of the first Pan-American Conference.  Blaine resigned as Secretary of State on June 4, 1892.

He was born in Kentucky on June 20, 1832, and graduated from Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1851.

On September 23, 1863 Bristow received an honorable discharge from the Union Army because he was selected to serve in the Kentucky senate.   Bristow was unaware that he had been elected and served only one term, until 1865.  One year later he became the US Attorney for the Kentucky District where he vigorously defended the Civil Rights Act of 1866.  From 1870-1872 he served as the first Solicitor General of the United States.  During his service, he argued issues related to Reconstruction and prosecuted thousands of Ku Klux Klan members.  In 1874, he became the United States Secretary of the Treasury and helped prosecute the Whisky Ring.  Following his resignation in 1876, he returned to New York to practice law and was later elected the second president of the American Bar Association.  He died in New York in 1896.</note>

In 1863 Cameron resigned, ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate, and was accused of bribing politicians in order to sway the election.  He was never formally charged with corruption.  Cameron supported Lincoln’s re-election, and in return, Lincoln appointed politicians loyal to Cameron to federal positions in Pennsylvania.  Consequently, Cameron’s political power grew and he soon became the leader of Pennsylvania’s political machine.  political influence was so great that he convinced President Ulysses S. Grant to appoint his son, James Donald Cameron, secretary of war in 1876.  His After James Donald resigned amongst rumors of corruption, Cameron resigned his seat in the US Senate, making sure that his son would replace him.  Simon Cameron died on June 26, 1899 at his home in Pennsylvania.</note>

He was born on October 30, 1829 in New York, studied at the Auburn Academy, and joined the bar in 1850.  He was elected to serve in the US House of Representatives in 1859 and later became a US Senator (1867-1881).   He helped draft the Electoral Commission Act of 1877, as well as the 14th and 15th amendments, and he supported and helped pass Reconstruction legislation and the Civil Rights Act of 1875. He was nominated in 1873 by Ulysses S. Grant to the post of chief justice of the Supreme Court, but declined the offer.  In 1876 he unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination.  By 1880 Conkling had become the leader of the Stalwart Faction of the Republican Party.  The Stalwarts staunchly supported Ulysses S. Grant in his bid for a presidential third term.  Due to divisions within the party, however, Republicans did not give Grant the nomination and opted instead to place James A. Garfield on the ticket.  He resigned from the Senate in 1881, returned to his law practice in New York City, and died on April 18, 1888.</note>

  <note type="biography">James Fisk was born on April 1, 1834 in Bennington, Vermont.  He was a financier, stockbroker, and one of the robber barons.  He formed a brokerage firm in 1866.  A few years later, he and his business partner Jay Gould fought Cornelius Vanderbilt for control of the Erie Railroad.  During the Erie War Gould and Fisk inflated the value of the stocks and thus succeeded in gaining control of the Erie Railroad.  The pair bribed and created alliances with a number of judges, legislators, and politicians including Boss Tweed.  On September 24, 1869, their financial schemes and dishonesty led to the panic of Black Friday.  Fisk was married to Lucy Moore, but had a relationship with Josie Mansfield.  Mansfield later began a relationship with Edward Stokes and the pair attempted to blackmail Fisk out of a large sum of money.  On January 6, 1872 an argument between Stokes and Fisk turned deadly when Stokes shot and murdered Fisk.  </note>

  <note type="biography">James Abram Garfield was the 20th president of the United States and was assassinated 200 days into his presidency.  He was born on November 19, 1831 in Ohio, and lost his father when he was two years old.  He graduated in 1856 from Williams College, became a classics professor, and served as president of the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute.  He became a state senator in 1859 and later a major general in the Union Army.  He served nine consecutive terms in the US House of Representatives from 1863 to 1880.  In 1880 Republicans nominated Garfield as their presidential candidate.  He won a narrow victory against his Democratic opponent Winfield S. Hancock.  As president, Garfield fought for civil service reform and called for an investigation of the Post Office.  On July 2, 1881 Charles Guiteau shot the President in a Washington D.C Railway Station.  Garfield died eighty days later on September 19, 1881.</note>

                <p>He was born in Point Pleasant, Ohio on April 27, 1822.  He graduated from West Point in 1843 and later became one of the most distinguished generals in the Union Army. In 1868 he was nominated to run as the Republican presidential nominee.  He won a sizeable victory over his Democratic opponent Horatio Seymour.  Grant served during Reconstruction and used the army to suppress violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan.  Grant initially maintained a peace policy towards Native Americans which he eventually was forced to abandon due to the increasing violence between Native Americans and settlers.  Grant was plagued by accusations of corruption and bribery because he often accepted lavish gifts, was photographed with the infamous Jay Gould and Jay Fisk, and appointed his family members to serve in government positions.  In fact, the term “Grantism” was used to signify corruption.  Consequently, Grant was unable to secure a third term as president. </p>
                
                <p>After leaving office, Grant went bankrupt and developed throat cancer.  In order to overcome his financial difficulties, he wrote his <hi rendition="#italics">Personal Memoirs</hi>  which eventually earned over $400,000.

  <note type="biography">Benjamin Harrison was the 23rd President of the United States.  He was born on August 20, 1833 in North Bend, Ohio and later practiced law.  He served in the Civil War and became a colonel.  In 1876, he unsuccessfully ran for governor of Indiana, but, four years later, was elected to serve in the US Senate.  In 1884 he lost the Republican presidential nomination to James Blaine and then in 1886 lost reelection to the Senate.  Two years later, however, he ran for president and launched a well organized and successful “front-porch” campaign in which he did not travel, but gave numerous speeches to visiting supporters.  He narrowly defeated the democratic incumbent Grover Cleveland, becoming the 23rd President of the United States.  At 5 feet 6 inches tall, Harrison became one the shortest US presidents, and democrats nicknamed him “Little Ben.”  As president, Harrison hosted the first Pan American Congress in 1889 and helped establish what would later become the Pan American Union.  He put forth legislation in Congress for the annexation of Hawaii which ultimately failed, signed the Sherman Anti-Trust law, and bolstered the American navy.  He ran for second term, but lost to Cleveland.  He died on March 13, 1901 in Indianapolis.</note>

  <note type="internal">http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50045037.html; depicted in 11747. Note/annotation from 11747: Cornelius ("Commodore") Vanderbilt made his fortune in the railroad business and in 1872, when this cartoon was published, was the richest man in America. His strong interest in spiritualism put him in touch with sisters <persName key="ENT.000002960">Victoria Woodhull</persName> and <persName key="ENT.000003633">Tennessee Claflin</persName>, who became his advisors. He provided silent financial backing for at least two historic firsts: the establishment of Woodhull and Claflin's brokerage firm, which made them the first women stock brokers, and Woodhull's presidential campaign, in which she became the first woman to run for president.</note>
