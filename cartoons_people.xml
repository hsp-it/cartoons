        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit, featuring
          500 encoded political cartoons, that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
          provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact with
          historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the National
          Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and

            <note type="biography">Chester Alan Arthur was a United States Vice President and
              President. He was born on October 5, 1829 in Fairfield, Vermont and was the son of an
              Irish immigrant. He graduated from Union College in New York in 1848, taught secondary
              school in Vermont and New York, and later became a lawyer in New York City. During the
              Civil War he served as Quartermaster General of the State of New York. After the War,
              Arthur rose within the ranks of the Republican Party because of his allegiance to
              Roscoe Conkling, a New York Senator and head of the Stalwart political machine. In
              1871 President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Arthur to serve as Collector of the New York
              Customhouse. In 1878 President Rutherford B. Hayes sought to reform the party and to
              end the practice of political patronage and so, he fired Arthur and accused the
              Customhouse of political corruption and patronage. Two years later, the Republicans,
              seeking to gain support of the Stalwarts, nominated Arthur as James A. Garfield’s
              running mate. After President Garfield was assassinated in 1881, Arthur became
              president, broke ties with Stalwarts, and began to enact civil service reform. On
              January 18, 1883, Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act which ensured
              federal employees they would be hired based on merit and not party loyalty. As
              President, Arthur worked to modernize the United States Navy and invested in the
              construction of steam-powered engines. He also supported lower tariffs and signed the
              Tariff Act of 1883.During Arthur’s Administration, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
              was enacted. It denied citizenship to Chinese immigrants and banned them from entering
              the United States. The law was finally repealed in 1943. During his presidency, Arthur
              became ill with kidney disease and lost the Republican nomination for the 1884
              election to James Blaine. He died on November 18, 1886.</note>

            <note type="biography">James Gillespie Blaine was born on January 31, 1830 in West
              Brownsville, Pennsylvania. He served as Secretary of State during the Benjamin
              Harrison and James A. Garfield Administrations and was the 31st Speaker of the US
              House of Representatives. Blaine graduated from Washington College in 1847 and became
              a newspaper editor in Augusta, Maine. In 1859 he was elected to serve in the Maine
              House of Representatives and later, in 1862, successfully ran for the US Congress. In
              1880 he lost the Republican Presidential nomination to James A. Garfield and, after
              the election, chosen to serve as Secretary of State. Four years later Republicans
              nominated him as their candidate, but he narrowly lost the presidential election to
              Grover Cleveland. In 1888, Benjamin Harrison appointed him Secretary of State. As
              Secretary of State, Blaine expanded trade with Latin America and served as chairman of
              the first Pan-American Conference. Blaine resigned as Secretary of State on June 4,
              1892. He died on January 27, 1893 in Washington, DC.</note>

            <note type="biography">Bristow was a lawyer, the first Solicitor General of the United
              States, and the 30th US Secretary of the Treasury. He was born in Kentucky on June 20,
              1832, and graduated from Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1851. He fought as a
              Union Soldier in the Civil War, was seriously wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in
              Tennessee, became the lieutenant colonel of the 8th Kentucky Calvary, and assisted in
              the 1863 capture of the Confederate raider John Hunt Morgan. On September 23, 1863
              Bristow received an honorable discharge from the Union Army because he was selected to
              serve in the Kentucky senate. Bristow was unaware that he had been elected and served
              only one term, until 1865. One year later he became the US Attorney for the Kentucky
              District where he vigorously defended the Civil Rights Act of 1866. From 1870-1872 he
              served as the first Solicitor General of the United States. During his service, he
              argued issues related to Reconstruction and prosecuted thousands of Ku Klux Klan
              members. In 1874, he became the United States Secretary of the Treasury and helped
              prosecute the Whisky Ring. Following his resignation in 1876, he returned to New York
              to practice law and was later elected the second president of the American Bar
              Association. He died in New York in 1896.</note>

              owner and editor. In 1822 was appointed to the post of State Printer and later in 1829
              became the Adjutant General of the Pennsylvania state militia. He became an
              influential politician whose support convinced Democrats to nominate Martin Van Buren
              as the 1832 vice presidential candidate. In addition to his work as a politician,
              Cameron was a successful businessman who earned his fortune in the banking and
              railroad industries. In 1845 he successfully ran for the US Senate and later, in 1861,
              became Abraham Lincoln’s secretary of war. He served a ten month term, resigned in
              1862 due to corruption allegations, and was appointed by Lincoln to serve as the
              ambassador to Russia. In 1863 Cameron resigned, ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate,
              and was accused of bribing politicians in order to sway the election. He was never
              formally charged with corruption. Cameron supported Lincoln’s re-election, and in
              return, Lincoln appointed politicians loyal to Cameron to federal positions in
              Pennsylvania. Consequently, Cameron’s political power grew and he soon became the
              leader of Pennsylvania’s political machine. political influence was so great that he
              convinced President Ulysses S. Grant to appoint his son, James Donald Cameron,
              secretary of war in 1876. His After James Donald resigned amongst rumors of
              corruption, Cameron resigned his seat in the US Senate, making sure that his son would
              replace him. Simon Cameron died on June 26, 1899 at his home in Pennsylvania.</note>

            <note type="biography">Roscoe Conkling was a congressman, politician, and leader of the
              Stalwart faction of the Republican Party. He was born on October 30, 1829 in New York,
              studied at the Auburn Academy, and joined the bar in 1850. He was elected to serve in
              the US House of Representatives in 1859 and later became a US Senator (1867-1881). He
              helped draft the Electoral Commission Act of 1877, as well as the 14th and 15th
              amendments, and he supported and helped pass Reconstruction legislation and the Civil
              Rights Act of 1875. He was nominated in 1873 by Ulysses S. Grant to the post of chief
              justice of the Supreme Court, but declined the offer. In 1876 he unsuccessfully sought
              the Republican presidential nomination. By 1880 Conkling had become the leader of the
              Stalwart Faction of the Republican Party. The Stalwarts staunchly supported Ulysses S.
              Grant in his bid for a presidential third term. Due to divisions within the party,
              however, Republicans did not give Grant the nomination and opted instead to place
              James A. Garfield on the ticket. He resigned from the Senate in 1881, returned to his
              law practice in New York City, and died on April 18, 1888.</note>

            <note type="biography">James Fisk was born on April 1, 1834 in Bennington, Vermont. He
              was a financier, stockbroker, and one of the robber barons. He formed a brokerage firm
              in 1866. A few years later, he and his business partner Jay Gould fought Cornelius
              Vanderbilt for control of the Erie Railroad. During the Erie War Gould and Fisk
              inflated the value of the stocks and thus succeeded in gaining control of the Erie
              Railroad. The pair bribed and created alliances with a number of judges, legislators,
              and politicians including Boss Tweed. On September 24, 1869, their financial schemes
              and dishonesty led to the panic of Black Friday. Fisk was married to Lucy Moore, but
              had a relationship with Josie Mansfield. Mansfield later began a relationship with
              Edward Stokes and the pair attempted to blackmail Fisk out of a large sum of money. On
              January 6, 1872 an argument between Stokes and Fisk turned deadly when Stokes shot and
              murdered Fisk. </note>

            <note type="biography">James Abram Garfield was the 20th president of the United States
              and was assassinated 200 days into his presidency. He was born on November 19, 1831 in
              Ohio, and lost his father when he was two years old. He graduated in 1856 from
              Williams College, became a classics professor, and served as president of the Western
              Reserve Eclectic Institute. He became a state senator in 1859 and later a major
              general in the Union Army. He served nine consecutive terms in the US House of
              Representatives from 1863 to 1880. In 1880 Republicans nominated Garfield as their
              presidential candidate. He won a narrow victory against his Democratic opponent
              Winfield S. Hancock. As president, Garfield fought for civil service reform and called
              for an investigation of the Post Office. On July 2, 1881 Charles Guiteau shot the
              President in a Washington D.C Railway Station. Due to his injuries, Garfield was no
              longer able to govern and died eighty days later on September 19, 1881.</note>

              <p>He was born in Point Pleasant, Ohio on April 27, 1822. He graduated from West Point
                in 1843 and later became one of the most distinguished generals in the Union Army.
                In 1868 he was nominated to run as the Republican presidential nominee. He won a
                sizeable victory over his Democratic opponent Horatio Seymour. Grant served during
                Reconstruction and used the army to suppress violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux
                Klan. Grant initially maintained a peace policy towards Native Americans which he
                eventually was forced to abandon due to the increasing violence between Native
                Americans and settlers. Grant was plagued by accusations of corruption and bribery
                because he often accepted lavish gifts, was photographed with the infamous Jay Gould
                and Jay Fisk, and appointed his family members to serve in government positions. In
                fact, the term “Grantism” was used to signify corruption. Consequently, Grant was
                unable to secure a third term as president. </p>
              <p>After leaving office, Grant went bankrupt and developed throat cancer. In order to
