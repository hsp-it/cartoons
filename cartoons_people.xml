                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit, featuring 500 encoded political cartoons, that will
                    demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and
                    contextual materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in
                    new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the National Historical

  <orgName key="ENT.000002503">Adams, John Quincy, 1767-1848</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>John Quincy Adams was the 6th president of the United States, serving from 1825 to 1829. Born in Braintree, Massachusetts, he was the son of John Adams, the 2nd president of the United States, and Abigail Adams. A  multilingual, Harvard-educated attorney, diplomat, and legislator, John Quincy Adams served as US minister to the Netherlands and Prussia before being elected to the Massachusetts State and then the US Senate in 1803, serving until 1808. He then was appointed ambassador to Russia (1809-1814) by President Madison. Adams, furthermore, assisted Madison in negotiating the Treaty of Ghent, which brought about the end of the War of 1812. As secretary of state under President Monroe (1817-1825) Adams was instrumental in shaping the Monroe Doctrine, acquiring the Floridas from Spain, and negotiating joint US-British occupation of the Oregon territory.</p>
<p>In 1824, Adams was one of five contenders for the US presidency, running against Andrew Jackson, John Calhoun, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay. Adams carried the Northeast, but Jackson beat Adams in both popular and electoral votes. No candidate, however, won a majority of electoral votes. Consequently, the US House of Representatives decided the election. Speaker of the House Henry Clay supported Adams, who won the presidency. Following his inauguration, Adams appointed Clay as secretary of state, prompting Jackson's supporters to accuse him of having struck a "corrupt bargain" in order to gain the presidency. In the subsequent presidential election of 1828, Adams lost to Jackson, becoming the first US president not to be elected to a second term. Adams retired briefly to farm life in Massachusetts but was elected to House of Representatives in 1830, where he served until his death in 1848, at age 80.</p></note>

  <note type="org">Chester Alan Arthur was a United States Vice President and President.  He was born on October 5, 1829 in Fairfield, Vermont.   He taught secondary school and later became a lawyer in New York City.  In 1871 President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Arthur to serve as Collector of the New York Customhouse.  In 1878 President Rutherford B. Hayes sought to reform the party and to end the practice of political patronage and so, he fired Arthur and accused the Customhouse of political corruption and patronage.   Two years later, the Republicans, seeking to gain support of the Stalwarts, nominated Arthur as James A. Garfield’s running mate.  After President Garfield was assassinated in 1881, Arthur became president, broke ties with Stalwarts, and began to enact civil service reform.   As President, Arthur worked to modernize the United States Navy and invested in the construction of steam-powered engines.  He also supported lower tariffs and signed the Tariff Act of 1883.  During Arthur’s Administration, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was enacted.  It denied citizenship to Chinese immigrants and banned them from entering the United States.  The law was finally repealed in 1943.  During his presidency, Arthur became ill with kidney disease and lost the Republican nomination for the 1884 election to James Blaine.  He died on November 18, 1886.</note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003692">Baker, Joseph E., approximately 1837-1914</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Joseph E. Baker was a lithographer and cartoonist, perhaps best known for his 1860 portrait of Abraham Lincoln drawn after his nomination as the Republican presidential candidate. Baker was born in about 1837 in Bangor, Maine, and moved to Boston by 1857, where he apprenticed at John H. Bufford’s lithographic firm. He became Bufford’s principal illustrator of sheet music. During the Civil War, Baker drew many political cartoons, primarily of the war itself. Baker worked for Bufford until Bufford’s death in 1870, while also working for other Boston firms. For Forbes and Company, Baker drew many playbills and advertisements. He eventually joined the firm of Armstrong &amp; Company. He remained active until 1888 and died in Danvers, Massachusetts in 1914.</p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003331">Bell, John, 1797-1869</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>John Bell was a US Representative and Senator from Tennessee. Born near Nashville, Tennessee, in 1796, he worked as a lawyer in Franklin, Tennessee, and served as a member of the Tennessee State Senate before being elected to the US House of Representatives in 1827. He served seven terms in the House (1827-1841), during which time he served one term as Speaker of the House (1833-1835) and chaired the Committee on Indian Affairs and Committee on the Judiciary. Initially a Jacksonian Democrat, Bell switched his loyalties and joined the Whig party during the 1830s. He was appointed by President William Henry Harrison as Secretary of War in 1841 but resigned later that year, after John Tyler, who became president following Harrison's death, refused to adopt a Whig agenda. Bell was later elected to the US Senate, serving two terms (1847-1859) during which time he changed party affiliations repeatedly, serving as, respectively, a member of the Whig, Opposition, and Know-Nothing parties.</p>
<p>In 1860, Bell changed his party affiliation yet again, becoming the presidential candidate for the newly founded Constitutional Union Party. The Constitutional Union Party officially took no position on slavery, declaring that it endorsed "no political principle other than the Constitution . . . the Union . . . and the Enforcement of the Laws." Their slogan was "No North, no South, no East, no West. Nothing but the Union." Bell was a Southern slaveholder but had opposed the expansion of slavery in the 1850s and did not support secession, arguing that it was unnecessary because the US Constitution already protected slavery.
The Constitutional Unionists did not believe they could win the election outright; their strategy was to gain votes that might otherwise go to other, stronger candidates. If no candidate in the 1860 presidential race won the number of electoral votes necessary to win the election, the decision would go to members of the House of Representatives, giving Bell would have a stronger chance of success. Seeing Lincoln as the biggest threat, supporters of the Constitutional Union Party created "fusion tickets" that combined the non-Republican candidates (besides Bell, these were John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democratic Party and Stephen Douglas of the Democratic Party) into a single-candidate ticket in some strategically important states. Most support for the Bell came from Southern states in which slavery was legal, and he carried the border states of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. Ultimately, Lincoln won the election.</p>
<p>Although he had initially opposed secession, Bell  supported the Confederacy after the outbreak of the Civil War. He died at his home near Cumberland Furnace, Tennessee, in 1869.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>Nicholas Biddle was born in 1786 to a prominent Philadelphia. A child prodigy, Nicholas enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania at age 10 and completed his studies there by age 13—he was ineligible to receive a degree, however, due to his young age. He subsequently enrolled at Princeton, graduating as valedictorian at age 15, and began a law career.  In 1804, Biddle traveled to Europe as the secretary to US Minister to France John Armstrong and later served as secretary to James Monroe in England. In 1807 he returned to the United States, where he edited Port-Folio magazine, prepared the notes of the Lewis and Clark expedition for publication, opened his own law practice, and was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1810 and the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1814. As a state representative, Biddle helped to establish a Pennsylvania public school system and to renew the charter of the Bank of the United States, which expired in 1811. He married Jane M. Craig in 1811, which whom he had six children.</p>
<p>President James Monroe appointed Biddle the federal government director of the re-chartered Second Bank of the United States, and in 1822, Biddle became its president. In 1832, however, President Andrew Jackson, who had been a longtime opponent of the bank, vetoed renewal of its charter. He followed up by withdrawing the federal government's funds from the bank in 1833, in a highly controversial move with widespread repercussions for the US economy. The bank's charter expired in 1836, but it continued as a state-chartered bank of Pennsylvania. Biddle resigned as president of the bank in 1839; it finally failed in 1841. Biddle died in 1844 at age 58.</p>

Four years later Republicans nominated him as their candidate, but he lost the presidential election to Grover Cleveland.  In 1888, Benjamin Harrison appointed him Secretary of State.  As Secretary of State, Blaine expanded trade with Latin America and served as chairman of the first Pan-American Conference.  Blaine resigned as Secretary of State on June 4, 1892.

  <orgName key="ENT.000003333">Breckinridge, John C. (John Cabell), 1821-1875</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>John Cabell Breckinridge was the 14th vice president of the United States and the only vice president to take up arms against the United States. Breckinridge was born and raised in Kentucky, where his family had deep roots. He worked as a lawyer in Lexington before serving as an officer in the Mexican-American War, then returned to Kentucky, where he began his political career. In 1849, at the age of 28, he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives; in 1851, running as a Whig, he was elected to the US Senate, serving until 1855. Breckinridge argued fiercely in support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, engaging in debates so rancorous that he nearly fought a duel with NY Representative Francis B. Cutting as a result. In 1856, Breckinridge was the running mate of presidential candidate James Buchanan, who won the election. At age 36, Breckinridge became the youngest vice president in US history.</p>
<p>He served as vice president from 1857-61 but had a strained relationship with Buchanan, who excluded Breckinridge from his administration and rarely communicated with him.</p>
<p>In 1860 the Democratic Party split when supporters of Stephen Douglas, the leading contender for the presidential nomination, refused to make support of slavery anywhere in the territories part of the party’s platform. Pro-slavery Democrats started their own Southern Democratic Party and chose Breckinridge as their presidential nominee. Breckinridge ran against Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln (whose wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, was a cousin of Breckinridge), Democratic candidate Stephen Douglas, and Constitutional Union Party candidate John Bell; ultimately, Lincoln won the election.</p>
<p>After the election Breckinridge briefly served in the US Senate (1861). He counseled against secession and, after several Southern states seceded from the Union, tried to convince his home state of Kentucky to remain neutral, rather than to take up arms against the Confederacy. Several months later, however, he volunteered to fight for the Confederacy, despite the fact that Kentucky remained part of the Union. He became the second vice president in US history (after Aaron Burr) to be accused of treason and was expelled from the Senate. Breckinridge rose from brigadier general  to major general in the Confederate Army, helped lead a Confederate raid on Washington, DC, in 1864, and, in 1865, became Jefferson Davis’s secretary of war. After the war ended, Breckinridge fled to Cuba and then to England, eventually settling in Toronto, Canada. Following President Andrew Johnson’s pardon of Confederates in 1868, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, where he resided for the rest of his life. He died in 1875 at the age of 54.</p></note>

He was born in Kentucky on June 20, 1832, and graduated from Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1851.  He fought as a Union Soldier in the Civil War, was seriously wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee, became the lieutenant colonel of the 8th Kentucky Calvary, and assisted in the 1863 capture of the Confederate raider John Hunt Morgan.  On September 23, 1863 Bristow received an honorable discharge from the Union Army because he was selected to serve in the Kentucky senate.   Bristow was unaware that he had been elected and served only one term, until 1865.  One year later he became the US Attorney for the Kentucky District where he vigorously defended the Civil Rights Act of 1866.  From 1870-1872 he served as the first Solicitor General of the United States.  During his service, he argued issues related to Reconstruction and prosecuted thousands of Ku Klux Klan members.  In 1874, he became the United States Secretary of the Treasury and helped prosecute the Whisky Ring.  Following his resignation in 1876, he returned to New York to practice law and was later elected the second president of the American Bar Association.  He died in New York in 1896.</note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000001011">Buchanan, James, 1791-1868</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>James Buchanan, sometimes referred to as “Old Buck,” was the 15th president of the United States, serving from 1857-61. He was the only president to hail from Pennsylvania as well as the only president never to marry.</p>
<p>Buchanan, one of 11 children, was born in 1791 outside of Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Dickinson College in 1809 and opened a law practice in Lancaster, then the capital of the state, in 1813. He served as a member of the state assembly from 1814 to 1815 before being elected to the US Congress, serving from 1821 to 1831, initially as a Federalist but eventually as a Jacksonian. From 1832-33, Buchanan served as US minister to Russia. In 1834, he was elected to the US Senate and served until 1845 before taking up the post of secretary of state under President James K. Polk, 1845-49.</p>
<p>In 1853, he became US minister to Great Britain. In this role, Buchanan was instrumental in drafting the controversial Ostend Manifesto, which justified taking Cuba from Spain. In 1856, shortly after returning from Great Britain, Buchanan was nominated for president by the Democratic Party and won the election. Before 1856, he had campaigned unsuccessfully for president in 1844, 1848, and 1858.</p>
<p>Buchanan’s presidency was defined by deepening controversy and division over issues of slavery. Two days after Buchanan was inaugurated, the US Supreme Court handed down its decision in the Dred Scott case, ruling that African Americans were not United States citizens and declaring unconstitutional the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had limited the spread of slavery in the US’s northern and western territories. The Missouri Compromise had already been undermined by passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, which allowed settlers in these territories to decide via popular vote whether or not to permit slavery. In Kansas, this had led to bloody violence between pro- and anti-slavery forces, and conflict over questions of admitting it to the Union as a state. Buchanan advocated allowing Kansas into the Union as a slave state, encouraging adoption of the Lecompton Constitution, a proposed pro-slavery state constitution ultimately rejected by Kansas voters. Buchanan’s longtime ally Stephen Douglas, arguing that Kansas’s state constitution should be decided by legitimate popular vote, broke with Buchanan and left his administration, an event that led to the splitting of the Democratic Party. John Brown’s 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry further deepened national tensions.</p>
<p>In 1860, Buchanan’s Democratic Party, now split between pro-slavery Southern Democrats who backed candidate John C. Breckinridge and traditional or Northern Democrats who supported Stephen Douglas, lost the election to Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln. Buchanan had promised at his inauguration to serve only one term, and did not seek reelection. In reaction to Lincoln’s election, South Carolina seceded from the Union in December 1860, and other Southern states followed suit. When Buchanan left office, the country was on the brink of war.</p>
<p>Buchanan, under attack from across the political spectrum for his failure to avert civil war, retired to Wheatland, his estate in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and died in 1868.</p>

  <note type="org"><p>John C. Calhoun was the South’s most vocal champion of state’s rights and most recognized symbol of the Old South. Born in Abbeville, in the South Carolina Piedmont, in 1782, Calhoun attended Yale and Litchfield Law School in Connecticut, and returned to his native South Carolina, where he briefly practiced law and then entered politics. After a term in the state legislature, Calhoun was elected to Congress as a Democratic Republican in 1811. He resigned in 1817 to become secretary of war for President James Monroe (1817-25), was elected vice president of the United States in 1824 with President John Quincy Adams and then in 1824 with President Andrew Jackson. He served as Jackson’s vice president from 1824 until December 28, 1832, when he resigned after winning election to the US Senate to fill a vacancy. Reelected in 1834 and 1840, he served in the Senate until March 1843. From 1844 to 1845 he served as secretary of state under President John Tyler, when he was again elected to fill a vacancy in the US Senate. He remained in the Senate until his death on March 31, 1850. Calhoun badly wanted, but never achieved, the presidency, despite three strong attempts. </p>
                
                <p>When Calhoun first entered national politics in 1811, he was a leading supporter of strong government, supporting a national road system, the second Bank of the United States, a strong military, and a protective tariff. In the 1830s, however, Calhoun became an extreme proponent of state’s rights and a strict construction of the Constitution. In 1831 he began publically defending nullification, the right of any state to nullify—or declare unconstitutional—objectionable federal legislation; Congress would then need to amend the Constitution to reinstate the nullified law. The tariff was the immediate object of the nullification debate, but Calhoun and other nullifiers were more concerned about protecting southern slavery. Most state’s rights advocated did not embrace Calhoun’s doctrine. By 1832, President Jackson broke with his vice president over such policy issues as well as over Calhoun’s role in the Eaton affair, in which several cabinet members and their wives ostracized Peggy Eaton, the new wife of John Eaton, secretary of war, for alleged adultery with Eaton while she was married to another man.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>William Charles, born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1776, is best known for his prolific political etchings, often embellished with aquatint, celebrating American military victories during the War of 1812. Historians Stephen Hess and Milton Kaplan deem him “the first major American cartoonist to work on American soil.”</p>
<p>Little is known about his professional training, but Charles had his own printing shop in London by at least 1803, out of which his earliest known prints, cartoons commenting on the Napoleonic Wars, were published. He moved back to Scotland and established a business called “Charles’s Emporium of Art and Fancy’s Produce” in Edinburgh sometime between February and July 1804. Charles emigrated to New York around 1806, possibly as a result of having raised the ire of British church authorities he had lampooned in his caricatures. There he published numerous political cartoons, etched plates for the <hi rendition="#italics">American Magazine of Wit</hi>, and published at least two illustrated children’s books: <hi rendition="#italics">Pompey the Little Who Was Tied to the Kettle</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">The Comic Adventures of Old Mother Hubbard and Her Dog</hi>. He moved to Philadelphia at some point between 1808 and 1814; he is listed in city directories and in the account books of Philadelphia publisher and economist Matthew Carey from at least 1808.</p>
<p>The War of 1812 represented Charles’s professional heyday; his  numerous political cartoons published in Philadelphia between 1812 and 1815 are his best-known works. At some point in or around 1813, Charles partnered with Samuel Kennedy, a Philadelphia carver, gilder, and looking-glass maker. The two collaborated on a handful of cartoons that commented on the war. For many of these prints, Kennedy seems to have been the primary artist and Charles the etcher and/or publisher. The pair also planned to publish a monthly folio of cartoons but were unable to raise the necessary funds.</p>
<p>After the War of 1812 ended, Charles largely did commercial engraving and publishing (bank notes, illustrated plates for reference books, and book illustrations) and produced some images of landscapes. He published few other political caricatures.</p>
<p>Charles died on August 9, 1820; on a journey to Boston to promote his toy books, he fell overboard into the Delaware River and drowned. He left behind a wife, Mary Charles, who published children’s books out of a shop in Philadelphia until her death in 1823.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>Born in Philadelphia in 1799, Edward Williams (E.W.) Clay became a prolific cartoonist of the Jacksonian era. Clay trained as a lawyer but also began working as an engraver during the course of his legal studies in the 1810s. Following his admittance to the bar in 1825, he departed for Europe to study art and began producing illustrations, covers for sheet music, portraits, and caricatures. After a few years, Clay returned to Philadelphia, where he produced his most famous and widely reproduced work, Life in Philadelphia (1828-30), a series of racist etchings mocking the supposed social and political aspirations of middle-class African Americans.</p>
<p>Clay worked extensively in the emerging field of lithography and from the early 1830s on produced mainly political cartoons, including many critical of Andrew Jackson. Around 1835, Clay moved from Philadelphia to New York, where he primarily designed cartoons published by other well-known printers such as H. R. Robinson and John Childs. By the early 1850s, Clay, whose eyesight was failing, largely abandoned art and printing for the legal sphere, leveraging family connections to serve as Clerk of the Court of Chancery and Clerk of the Orphan’s Court for Delaware from 1854 through 1856. He died of “pulmonary consumption” in New York on December 31, 1857, and was buried in Philadelphia.</p></note>

He was born on October 30, 1829 in New York, studied at the Auburn Academy, and joined the bar in 1850.  He was elected to serve in the US House of Representatives in 1859 and later became a US Senator (1867-1881).   He helped draft the Electoral Commission Act of 1877 and the 14th and 15th amendments.  He supported and helped pass Reconstruction legislation and the Civil Rights Act of 1875. He was nominated in 1873 by Ulysses S. Grant to the post of chief justice of the Supreme Court, but declined the offer.  In 1876 he unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination.  By 1880 Conkling had become the leader of the Stalwart Faction of the Republican Party.  The Stalwarts staunchly supported Ulysses S. Grant in his bid for a presidential third term.  Due to divisions within the party, however, Republicans placed James A. Garfield on the ticket.  Conkling resigned from the Senate in 1881, returned to his law practice in New York City, and died on April 18, 1888.</p>

  <orgName key="ENT.000001041">Davis, Jefferson, 1808-1889</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Jefferson Davis was the president of the Confederate States of America, a position he took with some reluctance but in which he served for six years. Like Abraham Lincoln, Davis was born in Kentucky to a modest farming family. The Davis’s did own a few slaves, and when Jefferson was still very young the family moved to Louisiana Territory and then to Mississippi. Davis returned to Kentucky to attend Transylvania University, and then he studied at the US Military Academy at West Point from 1824 to 1828. After graduation he served in the infantry in the West. In 1835, he resigned from the military, married the daughter of Zachary Taylor, and moved to Mississippi, where his new wife soon died from malaria and he became a cotton planter along with his brother Joseph.</p>

<p>In the 1840s, Davis became active in politics, and in 1845 he both married Varina Howell and was elected to Congress. In politics, Davis became a strong advocate of territorial expansion and of states’ right to extend slavery to them. Davis left Congress to serve in the Mexican War, but returned to Congress when he was appointed to the Senate in 1847. He strongly opposed the Compromise of 1850. In 1851, Davis resigned from the Senate to run for governor of Mississippi. He lost that race but he returned to politics when he was appointed secretary of war by President Franklin Pierce. He served in that position until 1857, when he was again elected as a Democrat to the US Senate. Despite his strong state’s rights views, Davis hoped that the South could remain within the Union. Following Lincoln’s election, Davis did not immediately support secession. Because of his moderation in the secession crisis, he became an attractive candidate for the Confederacy’s presidency, since he was acceptable to the Upper South. Davis accepted his election to the presidency with some reluctance. He would have preferred to have a military command. </p>

<p>As Confederate president, Davis was an effective leader, building a strong central government in spite of his own, and the South’s, state’s rights convictions. Davis wielded strong executive power, instituting conscription, exerting considerable control over transportation infrastructure and the economy. He was also involved in military planning. A good administrative leader, Davis was not, however, an inspirational one, and the South suffered from problems of morale.</p>

<p>Jefferson Davis was captured on May 10, 1865, in Irwinville, Georgia, as he and his family fled Union troops. It was rumored that he was fled in woman’s dress, though he really only had thrown on his wife’s overcoat as he tried to escape approaching troops. He was jailed for two years at Fortress Monroe. He was indicted for treason but was paroled in 1867. He returned to Mississippi, where he wrote <hi rendition="#italics">The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government</hi>. He died in New Orleans in 1889. In 1978, Davis’s citizenship was reinstated by a joint resolution of Congress.</p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003696">Farragut, David Glasgow, 1801-1870</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>David Glasgow Farragut was the first admiral of the United States. Farragut, born James Glasgow Farragut, was the son of a ferryboat operator and sailing master in the US Navy. James changed his name to David in 1814, in honor of David Porter Jr., who became young James’s guardian after his parents’ deaths. Farragut became a midshipman in 1810, at the age of nine. He served in the War of 1812 on the Essex, and at age twelve commanded the prize ship Alexander Barclay. After the war, Farragut served in the Mediterranean and the West Indies before marrying and settling in Norfolk, Virginia, where he lived until 1861. When Virginia seceded, Farragut left Norfolk, moving to Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where he awaited orders. He was called to duty in December 1861 with orders to take New Orleans and open the Mississippi River up to Union traffic. In contrast to George McClellan, Farragut was willing to take risks if he thought the potential gains significant. He was successful in taking New Orleans and the Mississippi River forts by summer 1862 and he was made a rear admiral. By the end of 1862, he had closed every Gulf port except Mobile. After suffering some defeats in 1863, Farragut returned to New York. He was back in the Gulf in early 1864, however, where his target was Mobile. During a battle that August, Farragut reportedly ordered “Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead” and succeeded in taking Mobile Bay, the first significant Union victory in nine months. On December 23, 1864, Lincoln signed a bill creating the office of vice admiral and nominated Farragut to it. Congress later created the rank of full admiral, specifically for Farragut, and he was appointed on July 26, 1866. After the war, Farragut toured Europe, promoting peaceful relations. After suffering from a heart attack from which he never fully recovered, he died at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1870.</p></note>

  <note type="org">James Fisk was born on April 1, 1834 in Bennington, Vermont.  He was a financier, stockbroker, and one of the robber barons.  He formed a brokerage firm in 1866.  A few years later, he and his business partner Jay Gould fought Cornelius Vanderbilt for control of the Erie Railroad.  During the Erie War Gould and Fisk inflated the value of the stocks and thus succeeded in gaining control of the Erie Railroad.  The pair bribed and created alliances with a number of judges, legislators, and politicians including Boss Tweed.  On September 24, 1869, their financial schemes and dishonesty led to the panic of Black Friday.  Fisk was married to Lucy Moore and his mistress was Josie Mansfield.  Mansfield later had an affair with Edward Stokes and the pair attempted to blackmail Fisk out of a large sum of money.  On January 6, 1872 an argument between Stokes and Fisk turned deadly when Stokes shot and killed Fisk.  </note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000000054">Franklin, Benjamin, 1706-1790</orgName>
  <note type="org"> <p>Although Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790)—prolific writer, scientist, inventor, and statesman—is perhaps best known for his work in drafting the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution and for his experiments with electricity, he also deserves to be celebrated for his significance as the publisher of America's first political cartoons.</p> 
  <p>Well before he gained prominence in the political sphere, Franklin made a name for himself as a printer. One of 17 children born to Josiah Franklin, a Boston soap- and candle-maker, Benjamin became an apprentice printer, working for his brother James, at age 12, and later ran away to establish his own printing business in Philadelphia.</p> 
  <p>In 1747, he published a pamphlet entitled <hi rendition="#italics">Plain Truth</hi>, which urged Pennsylvanians to establish militias to defend themselves against the French. To help make his point, the pamphlet included an illustration showing a horse-drawn wagon stuck in the mud and the wagon driver on his knees, praying to Hercules (seen sitting on a cloud above the scene) to assist him. The caption to this image reads “Non Votis,” a phrase contemporary readers would understand to mean “God helps those who help themselves.” Franklin had previously used this illustration in a popular schoolbook and accompanied it with the caption “He that won’t help himself, shall have Help from no Body.” By applying this image to make an argument in discussing a current political question, Franklin created what some historians consider the first American political cartoon. In his <hi rendition="#italics">Autobiography</hi>, Franklin recalled that Plain Truth and its imagery “had a sudden and surprising Effect” in mobilizing militia volunteers.</p> 
  <p>“Join, or Die,” the famous image of a segmented snake representing the American colonies, is more widely considered the first American political cartoon—it was certainly the first cartoon to be published in an American newspaper. This cartoon too was published by Franklin, in his newspaper the <hi rendition="#italics">Pennsylvania Gazette</hi>, on May 9, 1754. Within a month of publication, it had been reprinted in almost every newspaper in America and was reproduced and re-circulated during the Stamp Act crisis of 1765 and during the American Revolution. It remains one of the best-known images associated with the Revolutionary period to this day.</p>
                    <p>Ironically, although Franklin was the first American political cartoonist, he was also the first American public figure to be lampooned in political cartoons. As art historian William Murrell documents, half of the eight American cartoons that can be traced to the 1760s are images attacking Franklin. (These cartoons are held HSP and can be explored online at <ref target="http://digitallibrary.hsp.org">http://digitallibrary.hsp.org</ref>.) Thanks in part to these negative caricatures, Franklin lost his seat in the Pennsylvania Assembly as a result of its election in 1764.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>Ulysses Simpson Grant was a Union General and the 18th President of the United States.  He served two consecutive terms as president,1869-1876.</p>
                
                <p>He was born in Point Pleasant, Ohio on April 27, 1822.  He graduated from West Point in 1843 and later became one of the most distinguished generals in the Union Army. In 1868 he was nominated to run as the Republican presidential nominee.  He won a sizeable victory over his Democratic opponent Horatio Seymour.  Grant served during Reconstruction and used the army to suppress violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan.  Grant initially maintained a peace policy towards Native Americans which he eventually was forced to abandon due to the increasing violence between Native Americans and settlers.  Grant was plagued by accusations of corruption and bribery because he often accepted lavish gifts, was photographed with the infamous Jay Gould and Jay Fisk, and appointed his family members to serve in government positions.  In fact, the term “Grantism” was used to signify corruption.  Consequently, Grant was unable to secure a third term as president. </p>
                
                <p>After leaving office, Grant went bankrupt and developed throat cancer.  In order to overcome his financial difficulties, he wrote his <hi rendition="#italics">Personal Memoirs</hi>  which eventually earned over $400,000.

He served in the Civil War and became a colonel.  In 1876, he unsuccessfully ran for governor of Indiana, but, four years later, was elected to serve in the US Senate.  In 1884 he lost the Republican presidential nomination to James Blaine and then in 1886 lost reelection to the Senate.  Two years later, however, he ran for president and launched a well organized and successful “front-porch” campaign in which he did not travel, but gave numerous speeches to visiting supporters.  He narrowly defeated the democratic incumbent Grover Cleveland, becoming the 23rd President of the United States.  At 5 feet 6 inches tall, Harrison became one the shortest US presidents, and democrats nicknamed him “Little Ben.”  As president, Harrison hosted the first Pan American Congress in 1889 and helped establish what would later become the Pan American Union.  He put forth legislation in Congress for the annexation of Hawaii which ultimately failed, signed the Sherman Anti-Trust law, and bolstered the American navy.  He ran for second term, but lost to Cleveland.  He died on March 13, 1901 in Indianapolis.</note>

  <note type="org"><p>Rutherford Hayes was the nineteenth President of the United States and the first US president to graduate from law school.</p>
                <p>Hayes was born in Ohio and was raised by a single mother. His father died ten weeks before Hayes’ birth.  During the Civil War, he served as major general for the Union Army was wounded in battle five times, but continued to serve. Because of his bravery in battle, he quickly earned a reputation as war hero and, in 1864, was elected to serve in the United States House of Representatives.  He served from 1865-1867 and later became the Governor of Ohio from 1868-1872 and 1876-1877.  </p>
                <p>In 1876, Hayes became the Republican presidential nominee, defeating popular republican politicians such as James G. Blaine and Roscoe Conkling.  His Democratic opponent, Samuel Tilden of New York, was a formidable opponent, excellent campaigner, and well-known reformer.  </p>
                <p>The 1876 presidential election became one of the most contested in US history. The votes were so close that both candidates could claim victory in Florida, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Oregon.  In order to decide the election, Congress organized a special electoral commission.  The fifteen member commission awarded the presidency to Hayes which led some to question the legitimacy of his presidency. Some Democrats nicknamed Hayes “Rutherfraud” and “His Fraudulency.”</p>
                <p>Hayes sought to strengthen the presidency and to end the practice of political patronage.  His civil service reforms put him at constant odds with Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. He served only one term and did not seek re-election in 1880.  He died in 1893.</p>

  <orgName key="ENT.000002223">Jackson, Andrew, 1767-1845</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Andrew Jackson was the military hero and seventh president of the United States. Jackson was born in western South Carolina to a recently widowed mother with two young sons. By age fourteen, Jackson had lost his brothers and mother as well. Despite this inauspicious beginning, Jackson became a successful lawyer and politician in Tennessee, where he had settled in 1788. Jackson served in the convention that drafted Tennessee’s constitution, and then, once Tennessee was admitted to statehood, he became the state’s sole representative to the US House of Representatives in 1796. In 1797 he was elected to the US Senate. After a short, undistinguished congressional career, Jackson resigned from the Senate to serve on the Superior Court of Tennessee. 
</p>
<p>Jackson’s military career included command of Tennessee forces in the Creek War of 1813, which led to his commission as major general in the US Army in 1814. He is best known for his victory of the British in the Battle of New Orleans at the conclusion of the War of 1812. This victory made Jackson a national hero. Jackson’s soldiers named him “Old Hickory” because of his strength during hardship. In 1818 he led an expedition that captured Florida, and then in 1821 he served as governor of the new territory. He resigned that post in 1821 and returned to Tennessee, where the state legislature nominated him for president in 1822.</p>

<p>Jackson was one of four candidates for president in 1824. Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote, but because he did not have a majority, the election was decided by the House of Representatives, which selected John Quincy Adams, who then named fourth-place finisher Henry Clay as secretary of state in what Jackson labeled a “corrupt bargain.” With that, Jackson’s 1828 campaign for the presidency began and the Jacksonian Democratic Party was born. The 1828 campaign between Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams was one of the nation’s nastiest. Jackson won by a wide margin.</p>

<p>Jackson was a champion of the common man and of majority rule, and used his veto to strike at what he considered to be special interests. He also was a strong nationalist and rejected Vice President John Calhoun’s belief that states could nullify federal legislation they disliked. Calhoun and Jackson broke over nullification and other issues and Martin Van Buren ran with Jackson for vice president in 1832. Recharter of the powerful Second Bank of the United States became the primary issue during the 1832 presidential campaign between Jackson and Henry Clay. In July 1832, Jackson had vetoed a bill to recharter the bank sponsored by Clay. Jackson then defeated Clay in the presidential election and in 1833 he ordered that government funds be moved from the Bank of the United States and placed in selected state banks. Jackson’s adversaries depicted him as a tyrant, labeling him “King Andrew.” No doubt, Jackson was a divisive figure in American politics. By the end of this presidency, the clear two party system, Whigs and Democrats, was in place.</p>

<p>Jackson returned to Tennessee in 1837, where he died in 1845.</p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003356">Johnson, Andrew, 1808-1875</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>
Andrew Johnson was the seventeenth president of the United States, taking office after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865. Johnson was a southern Democrat, born in North Carolina and living most of his life in East Tennessee. Johnson grew up in a poor family, lost his father at an early age, and was apprenticed to a tailor, and then ran away. He settled in Greeneville, Tennessee, where he set up a tailor shop, married, raised a family, and entered local politics. In 1835 he was elected to the Tennessee legislature, lost that seat in 1837, and then regained it in 1839. In 1843 he was elected to the US House of Representatives as a Jacksonian Democrat.  He served in the House for ten years, where he was a sponsor of the homestead bill, which provided western settlers with public land. This support alienated many southern conservatives since this measure could weaken slavery. Johnson was not abolitionist, however. Indeed, he owned several slaves and was a strong believer in white supremacy and state’s rights. When gerrymandered out of his House seat in 1853, Johnson ran for governor of Tennessee instead, and won. In 1857 he was chosen US Senator. In the Senate he continued his advocacy for the homestead bill. </p>

<p>In 1860, Johnson hoped to run for the presidency on the Democratic ticket. He was unsuccessful in securing the nomination, and when the party split, he endorsed the proslavery ticket of John Breckenridge and Joseph Lane. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election, however, Johnson remained a strong Unionist and opposed secession. He remained in the Senate during the secession crisis, even after Tennessee seceded from the Union—though East Tennessee remained Unionist. This action made Johnson a hero in the North. In March 1862, after the fall of Nashville, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee.
</p>
<p>In 1864, in an effort to attract war Democrats to the Lincoln ticket, the National Union Part nominated Johnson for vice president. He served as vice president for just over a month before Lincoln was assassinated and Johnson assumed the presidency. Because he believed that the Southern states had never actually seceded and in state’s rights, he initiated a Reconstruction policy that angered Northern Radical Republicans. He pardoned nearly all Southerners who would take an oath of allegiance, requiring only Southern leaders and men of wealth to obtain special presidential pardons. He also did not insist that Southern states enfranchise freedmen. These policies set up a battle with the Congress. Johnson vetoed several measures, including, in February 1866, the Freedman’s Bureau bill, and in March 1866, a civil rights bill. Congress overrode the veto of the Civil Rights Act and passed a new Freedman’s Bureau bill in June 1866, which Johnson was not able to veto. In fall 1866 Radical Republicans won in the congressional elections, further weakening Johnson. In 1867, he attempted to settle remaining claims with Great Britain, including the <hi rendition="#italics">Alabama</hi> claims for damages to North from British built ships serving the Confederacy, but his efforts were rejected by the Senate. In March 1867, Congress enacted the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval for dismissal of presidential appointees, and also began their own Reconstruction program. They also began efforts to impeach Johnson. After one failed attempt, Johnson was impeached for violations of the Tenure of Office Act in February 1868. The Senate then acquitted him by one vote in May 1868. In March 1869, Johnson left the presidency and returned to Tennessee. In 1875 he was returned to the US Senate. He died a few months later in Carter’s Station, Tennessee.

When he was seventeen years old, he traveled throughout Europe, earning a modest living as a painter.  He joined a traveling theatrical company, designed their sets, performed on stage, and spent the next several years traveling.  In 1864, he married Minna Rubens and sought more stable employment.  He worked for time as a cartoonist for the humor magazine <hi rendition="#italics">Kikeriki</hi>.  In 1867, he immigrated to the United States.

Keppler hired talented cartoonists such as Frederick Opper, Bernard Gillam, and James A. Wales.   The magazine covered topics such as immigration, political scandals, and presidential elections and its cartoons were heavily influenced by contemporary and classical art and literature.

  <orgName key="ENT.000000447">Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Abraham Lincoln was elected sixteenth present of the United States in 1860, leading to the secession of the Southern states and the American Civil War. Lincoln was born to poor parents in Kentucky in 1809, spent some of his childhood in Indiana, then moved with his family to Illinois in the 1830s. As a young man, Lincoln earned some money splitting rails for other farmers, earning him the nickname the “Rail Splitter” later in life. In 1831 he settled in New Salem, Illinois, where he worked several jobs, joined a debating society, and became interested in politics. In 1834 he won election to the Illinois legislature as a Whig. While in the legislature, Lincoln studied law and obtained his license and began his legal practice. He retired from the legislature in 1841 and continued his legal practice. In 1842, he married Mary Todd, with whom he had four sons. In 1846, Lincoln achieved his ambition to serve in Congress, and he served in Congress from 1847 to 1849. He then returned to his legal practice in Springfield, Illinois. In 1854, passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act propelled Lincoln back into politics. Lincoln strongly opposed of the extension of slavery into the western territories and he ran for the state legislature on a platform that opposed the act. In February 1855, however, he resigned from the legislature to become the Whig candidate for the US Senate but he failed to secure that seat. In 1858, the Republican Party nominated Lincoln its candidate for US Senate against Democrat Stephen Douglas. The famous Lincoln-Douglas debates over the extension of slavery brought Lincoln to national attention—though the state legislature reappointed Douglas to the Senate.
</p>
<p>When it came time to nominate a candidate for president in 1860, Lincoln emerged from the Republican National Convention in Chicago as the Republican nominee, beating out leading candidate William H. Seward of New York. The four-way election, with the Democrats split between northern and southern wings and a remnant of the Whig Party reorganizing as the Constitutional Union Party, allowed Lincoln to win the presidency with only 40 percent of the popular vote. Lincoln’s election precipitated the secession of the Southern states in the winter of 1860-61. Within weeks of Lincoln’s open rebellion began with the firing on Fort Sumter by Confederate soldiers. Originally a war to preserve the Union, by 1862, Lincoln was under pressure make the abolition of slavery a war aim. Instead, Lincoln moved to end slavery in those Confederate states still in rebellion as a military tactic. After issuing a draft proclamation in September 1862, Lincoln issued the final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863.</p>

<p>While waging war against the Southern states, Lincoln also faced a tough battle within his party and his administration. Disagreements over prosecution of the war and its aftermath led to a contentious Republican nominating convention in 1864. Lincoln won the nomination, and the election, defeating his former general, George McClellan, who ran on the Democratic ticket. Lincoln lived to see the end of the war, but not the enactment of his Reconstruction policies. He was shot at while watching a comedy at Ford’s Theatre in Washington, DC, on April 14, 1865, and he died the following morning.</p></note>

In New York, Magee worked in the lithographic firms of James Baillie and Nathaniel Currier and produced illustrations for several children’s picture books during the 1840s and 1850s. From at least 1850-1852 he seems to have had his own establishment at 34 Mott Street in New York, from which he published cartoons. Magee relocated to Philadelphia at some point after 1852 and began to be listed as a lithographer in Philadelphia city directories by 1855. In Philadelphia, Magee worked as a lithographer for his own firm, which had several addresses at different times, as well as working for the publishing firms of Thomas Sinclair, Benjamin Mifflin, Frederick Pilliner, and John Hart. He was married to Anne Magee, with whom he had three children: Emma, Walter, and Howard. Although he still listed himself as a lithographer at the time of the 1870 census, he seems not to have produced lithographs after the 1860s. The year of his death is unknown.</note>

  <note type="org">The German-born artist, lithographer, and painter Louis Maurer is believed to be responsible for the most well-known political cartoons published by the printing firm of Currier and Ives during the Civil War era, although these images rarely bore his name. Maurer was born in Biebrich, in the Rhineland, in 1832 and studied art and lithography in Mainz. He migrated to the Unites States with his family in 1851 and began working for the lithographic firm of T. W. Strong before being hired by Currier and Ives in 1852. He worked for Currier and Ives for eight years, during which time he became the firm’s foremost artist of political cartoons. He moved on to the firm of Major and Knapp before establishing his own firm, Maurer and Heppenheimer, in 1872. He was successful enough to retire in 1884, at the age of 52, and devote himself painting. At the time of his death in New York in 1932—at age 100—Maurer was the last surviving member of the Currier and Ives staff and the oldest living American artist. </note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000001783">McClellan, George Brinton, 1826-1885</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>
George Brinton McClellan was a Civil War general and presidential candidate. He was beloved by his troops but exasperating to President Lincoln, and he is ultimately remembered more for his failures than for his successes. George McClellan was born in 1826 in Philadelphia, where he studied law at the University of Pennsylvania before giving up the law to pursue a career in the military. McClellan secured an appointment to West Point and graduated second in his class in 1846. McClellan served in the Mexican War and on various western army expeditions. He was viewed as a rising star, but he left the army in 1857 to become superintendent of the Illinois Central Railroad. McClellan, a former Whig, became a Democrat by 1858, and he supported Stephen Douglas against Abraham Lincoln in the US Senate race and again in the 1860 presidential election. By 1861, his love of the military drew him back to the army. In April he was appointed commander of the Ohio troops. By July, Lincoln gave McClellan command of the Union troops in Washington, DC, and in August he formed the Army of the Potomac and in November was named general-in-chief of the Union armies. McClellan, known as the “Young Napoleon,” soon won the affection of his men, but he soon began to frustrate Lincoln. McClellan’s extreme caution or lack of nerve led him to forestall providing Lincoln with any war plans or to commit his troops to action. By March 1862, Lincoln relieved McClellan of the office of general-in-chief, and the following fall he removed McClellan from command of the Army of the Potomac and transferred him to Trenton, New Jersey.</p>

<p>In 1864, McClellan sought, and won, the Democratic nomination for president. The nominating convention, however, was dominated by peace Democrats, who adopted a platform declaring the war a failure. McClellan tried to distance himself from this platform by declaring his intention of continuing the war until the Union was restored. McClellan lost the election in a landslide, in part because of significant Union victories in the months leading up to the election, and in part because the Democrats were viewed as the party of disunity. McClellan then traveled to Europe, where he lived for three years before returning to New Jersey to pursing engineering work. He was elected governor of New Jersey in 1877 and served one term. He died at his home in Orange, New Jersey, in 1885.</p>

  <note type="org"><p>Thomas Nast was perhaps the greatest American political cartoonist of the nineteenth century. He is credited shifting the focus on cartooning from text to imagery and with popularizing the symbols of the donkey and the elephant for the Democratic and Republican Parties. He also is responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus. Thomas Nast was born in Bavaria in 1840 and moved to New York City with his parents in 1846. There Nast studied art, and in 1855 he was hired as a staff artist for <hi rendition="#italics">Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper</hi>. Three years later he became a freelance artist for <hi rendition="#italics">Harper’s Weekly</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">New York Illustrated News</hi>. In 1860, Nast traveled to Europe, where he covered subjects such as Garibaldi’s campaigns in Italy and English boxing. He returned to New York in 1861, where he married Sarah Edwards and sketched for the <hi rendition="#italics">Illustrated News</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">Leslie’s</hi> before rejoining <hi rendition="#italics">Harper’s Weekly</hi> in 1862. During the Civil War, Nast’s most influential work captured the political issues dividing the nation and used domestic scenes to bolster the Union cause. After the war, Nast used his pen to comment on Reconstruction, black rights, and party politics. In the 1870s, he used his cartoons fight the corruption of New York’s Boss Tweed and Tammany Hall. In politics, Nast was a Republican, and he supported the Grant administration and the need for federal intervention in the South. Nash was at the peak of his popularity and power during the postwar years. His influence declined in the latter years of the nineteenth century. He left <hi rendition="#italics">Harper’s Weekly</hi> in 1886 and failed in his attempt to establish his own journal. In 1902, Theodore Roosevelt appointed him a consul to Ecuador, where he succumbed to yellow fever in that same year.</p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003535">Noah, M. M. (Mordecai Manuel), 1785-1851</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Born Philadelphia July 19, 1785, Mordecai Manuel Noah was a prominent  writer, newspaper editor, and political officeholder of the new republic. The son of Manuel Noah, who had immigrated from Mannheim, Germany, and served in the Revolutionary War, and Zipporah Phillips, whose grandfather had served as the <hi rendition="#italics">hazan</hi> of the Shearith Israel Congregation of New York—the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States. Orphaned at a young age, Noah worked as a carver’s apprentice and studied at the Franklin Library. He later worked as a clerk for the auditor’s office in Philadelphia before moving to Harrisburg to become a reporter for the Pennsylvania Legislature. By the outbreak of the War of 1812, Noah was editor of the <hi rendition="#italics">City Gazette</hi> of Charleston, SC, and an outspoken advocate of war with Britain. </p>
  <p>In 1813 the 28-year-old Noah was appointed US Consul to the Kingdom of Tunis, but his position was recalled. Although the likely reason for his recall was that he spent more money than had been authorized by the government to ransom an American ship’s crew that had been taken by Algerian pirates and enslaved, the reason given in President James Monroe’s letter was that Noah’s religion, Judaism, represented “an obstacle to the exercise of his function.” This decision aroused outrage among many American Jews and non-Jews alike.</p>
  <p>Upon his return to the United States, Noah settled in New York, where he became sheriff of the city and county of New York in 1822, was appointed surveyor and inspector of the Port of New York by President Andrew Jackson in 1829, and became a judge of the New York Court of Sessions in 1841. Noah also founded and edited a number of newspapers, including the <hi rendition="#italics">National Advocate</hi> (1816-1824), and the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Enquirer</hi> (1826-1829), which soon merged with James Watson Webb’s Courier to become the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi>.  Webb and Noah’s partnership dissolved over the editors’ disagreement over the Bank of the United States; Noah supported President Jackson’s controversial decision to remove government deposits from the bank, while Webb opposed it. In 1834, Noah founded the <hi rendition="#italics">Evening Star</hi>, the country’s leading Whig newspaper, and in 1842 established the <hi rendition="#italics">Union</hi>, which was later renamed <hi rendition="#italics">Noah’s Sunday Times and Messenger</hi>. Noah was also an active member of New York’s Tammany Hall political machine and helped to found what would become New York University.
  In addition to his impressive journalistic career and his involvement in politics, Noah was also a prolific writer, penning popular plays such as <hi rendition="#italics">The Fortress of Sorrento</hi> (1808), <hi rendition="#italics">She Would be a Soldier</hi> (1819), and <hi rendition="#italics">The Siege of Tripoli</hi> (1820). Noah was also a proto-Zionist who attempted to found a Jewish homeland in the United States. In 1820, Noah petitioned the US government to purchase Grand Island, located in the Niagara River near Buffalo, NY, in the hopes of making this land a state for Jewish immigrants. He purchased Grand Island in 1825 and dubbed it “Ararat” in a lavish ceremony marked by proclamations, pageants, and orations. Noah shortly realized that his plan was unworkable, however, and advocated establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, anticipating the ideas of modern Zionism by a good fifty years.</p>
  <p>Noah married Rebecca Jackson (no relation to Andrew Jackson), with whom he had seven children. He died following a stroke in 1851.</p></note>

                <p>Pennypacker was born on April 9, 1843 in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.  He attended Grovemont Seminary and was accepted into Yale University.  His grandfather decided not to pay his tuition until he got some experience in the workforce.  In 1862 Pennypacker became a teacher at Mont Clare in Montgomery County, and the following year, enlisted in the 26th Pennsylvania Emergency Regiment.  After fighting in the militia, he returned to his studies and attended law school at the University of Pennsylvania.  In 1870 he married Virginia Earle Broomall.</p>
                <p>He served on the Philadelphia Board of Education in 1885 and later became the judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia.

The bill would make it illegal for publishers to print cartoons depicting politicians as animals.  Violators of the law would be susceptible to a $1000 fine and a maximum of two years in jail.  Pusey’s bill never became law, but the Salus-Grady bill which imposed similar restrictions was signed into law on May 12, 1903.

  <note type="org"><p>John Davison Rockefeller was a wealthy American business tycoon, philanthropist, and founder of Standard Oil.</p>  
<p>Rockefeller was born on July 8, 1839 in New York.  His father, William Avery Rockefeller, was a snake-oil salesman who sold treatments which he claimed would cure serious illnesses.   His mother, Eliza Davison, was a devout Baptist who instilled in her children a strong work ethic.</p>
               <p> At the age of sixteen on September 26, 1855, Rockefeller got his first job as an assistant bookkeeper with Hew &amp; Tuttle.  His employers were immediately impressed with his work and began giving him greater responsibilities.  In 1859, Rockefeller decided to open his own business and partnered with Maurice Clark to form the produce commission business, Clark &amp; Rockefeller.  They sold hay, grain, and other goods and over the next several years, yielded large profits. </p>
                <p>In 1870, he partnered with his brother and several others to form Standard Oil.  In 1870, Standard Oil accounted for 10% of the nation’s oil industry.

On May 15, 1911 the United States Supreme Court declared Standard Oil in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and ordered its dissolution. </p> 
                <p>Rockefeller was also a philanthropist who donated hundreds of millions of dollars.  He helped found the University of Chicago, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, and the Rockefeller Foundation.  He died on May 23, 1937.</p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000002738">Roosevelt, Theodore, 1858-1919</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Theodore Roosevelt was the 26th President of the United States.</p>
                <p>Roosevelt was born on October 27, 1858 in New York City and was the second child of Martha Bulloch Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.  At a young age, Roosevelt developed bronchial asthma, a condition that was so severe, he almost died.  He had poor vision and at the age of fourteen began wearing glasses.  Despite his medical conditions, Roosevelt was a curious and energetic young boy.  He was interested in natural history, collected insects, and performed taxidermy on birds and other small creatures. When he was only nine years old he wrote a natural history paper entitled “The Natural History of Insects.”  Roosevelt’s poor health began to improve at the age of twelve when his father built him a gymnasium in the family home.  He lifted weights and learned how to box.  Roosevelt’s parents sought to expand their children’s world view and hired tutors to teach the children French, German, and Latin.  The family spent a year in Europe and the Middle East.  Roosevelt was mostly home schooled as a child, and in 1876 enrolled at Harvard College.  On October 27, 1880 Roosevelt married Alice Hathaway Lee.  Alice died on February 14, 1884, two days after giving birth to their daughter Alice.  His mother passed away from typhoid fever the same day.  Roosevelt was distraught and sent his daughter away to live with one of his sisters.</p>  
                <p>In 1886, he unsuccessfully ran for mayor of New York.  On December 2, 1886 he married his second wife, Edith Kermit Carow.  From 1895-1897, he served as the head of the New York City Board of Police Commissioners.  In 1897, he was appointed assistant secretary of the navy.  In 1898, he became a military hero when he led the Rough Riders Regiment to victory at the battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. He served as the governor of New York from 1899 to 1901.  He became vice president in 1901 and President on September 14, 1901 after President McKinley’s assassination.  At the age of 42, he became the youngest president in American history.  He served from 1901-1909.</p>
                <p>Roosevelt’s administration began what would be later known as the progressive era.  As president, he enacted numerous reforms, expanded the powers of the executive office, and became known as the great “trust buster” who broke up Standard Oil and filed forty anti-trust lawsuits.  During the anthracite coal strike, he became the first president to use his powers to negotiate and settle a labor dispute.  He expanded trade, built the Panama Canal, increased US military power and presence in the Western hemisphere, and was an imperialist who supported American expansionism.

  <note type="org"><p>Philip Henry Sheridan was born to an Irish laborer and his wife who migrated from Ireland to Somerset, Ohio, with a brief stay in Albany, New York, in 1830–31. It is not clear exactly where Philip was born. In Ohio, Sheridan received a rudimentary education and then worked as a bookkeeper in a dry goods store before winning an appointment to the US Military Academy at West Point in 1848. After graduation, Sheridan served on frontier duty in the West, until he was ordered to Missouri in September 1861 to join a new infantry unit under General Halleck. Sheridan was made chief commissary and quartermaster for the Army of the Southwest Missouri District. While he excelled in this position, he longed to command troops in the field. He finally secured such a command in spring 1862 when he was offered the position of commander of the volunteer Second Michigan Cavalry. From there, Sheridan quickly moved up, winning the admiration of his troops and superiors alike. He was promoted to brigadier general of US Volunteers by mid-1862. His battlefield courage and skills were admired by General U. S. Grant, who appointed Sheridan chief of cavalry in early 1864. Now brigadier general, US Army, in May 1864 Sheridan led his cavalry to Richmond, where he defeated Confederate cavalry forces under Jeb Stuart, further earning him the Grant’s respect. A year later, in April 1865, Sheridan’s cavalry played an important role in Lee’s surrender at Appomattox, though Sheridan himself was disappointed that he was not given the opportunity to crush the Confederate troops and instead they were allowed to negotiate their surrender.</p> 
                
                <p>After the Civil War, Sheridan was sent to New Orleans, where he commanded the Military Division of the Gulf and then was briefly military governor of Louisiana and Texas. In 1867, Sheridan returned to the West, where, except for a two-year hiatus when he served as an official observer of the Franco-Prussian War, he directed several campaigns against the Plains Indians. In 1883, Sheridan was named general in chief of the US Army. Sheridan published his memoirs in 1888. In that same year, he suffered a series of heart attacks, and he died at his summer cottage in Nonquitt, Massachusetts.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>John Sherman was born on May 10, 1823 in Ohio and was the brother of William Tecumseh Sherman.  He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1844.  He represented Ohio in the US House of Representatives from 1855 to 1861.  Sherman became a US Senator in 1861 and served until 1877.  As Senator, he supported the passage of the National Bank Act and the Legal Tender Act which helped finance the war effort.  He also helped draft the Reconstruction Act of 1867, supported the Fifteenth Amendment, and voted to impeach Andrew Johnson.  In 1877, Sherman left the Senate to serve as Secretary of the Treasury during the Hayes’ administration.  He left Hayes’ cabinet in 1881 and returned to the United States Senate where he remained until 1897.  As Senator, he authored the Sherman Anti-Trust Act which limited the power of monopolies.   Although he was an influential and well respected politician, Sherman lost his bid to become the Republican presidential nominee three times (1880, 1884, and 1888).  In 1897, President McKinley appointed him Secretary of State, but, due to failing health, he resigned after serving only one year.  Sherman died on October 22, 1900.</p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003694">Sherman, William T. (William Tecumseh), 1820-1891</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>William Tecumseh Sherman was one of the Union’s most famous generals, best known for his efforts to demoralize the South through the destruction of property, epitomized in his March through Georgia in the fall of 1864. Sherman was born in Lancaster, Ohio, in 1820, to a prominent state judge, one of 11 children. The death of his father in 1829, however, left his family destitute, and William became the ward of Ohio lawyer and politician Thomas Ewing. In 1836, Sherman entered the US Military Academy, where he excelled. After his graduation in 1840, he served mostly in the South, including in the Seminole War. During the Mexican War, he was stationed in California, where he saw no combat. He returned east in 1850, where he married Ewing’s daughter, Ellen Ewing. He left the military at her insistence in 1853. From 1853 until 1861, Sherman worked as a banker and businessman in various locations. By 1859, Sherman was eager to reenter the army and was able to secure the position of superintendent of the Louisiana Military Seminary, where he served until February 1861, when he left when Louisiana seceded from the Union. A few months later he became a colonel in the regular army. Sherman performed valiantly at Shiloh and served as military governor of Memphis in 1862, where he came to recognize the important role that civilians—and morale—played in the war. In 1863, Sherman participated in the Vicksburg campaign and was promoted to brigadier general. That fall, Sherman was named commander of the Department of the Army of the Tennessee. Sherman first implemented his strategy to break the South through the widespread destruction of property in the Meridian Campaign of early 1864, leaving behind a path of destruction from Jackson to Meridian, Mississippi. In March 1864, Sherman became commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi and in charge of all military operations in the West. Sherman began his famous March through Georgia on September 1, 1864, following the fall of Atlanta, reaching Savannah on December 21.</p>                 
                <p>Despite his devastating approach to war, Sherman advocated a lenient peace, and in April 1865 he negotiated such a peace with Confederate general Joseph Johnston. A nation recently traumatized by Lincoln’s assassination, however, forced him to renegotiate the peace treaty. After the war, Sherman remained in the army, and when Grant was elected president, Sherman became commanding general. Sherman retired in 1883 and later settled in New York City, where he died in 1891.</p></note>

Roosevelt quarreled with Taft and accused him of abandoning the ideals of the progressive movement.  In 1912, Roosevelt formed the Progressive or “Bull Moose” Party and ran against Taft.  The split in the Republican Party helped Woodrow Wilson to win the White House.</p>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003169">Taylor, Zachary, 1784-1850</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Zachary Taylor (November 24, 1784-July 9, 1850) was the 12th President of the United States, serving from March 1849 until his death in July 1850. Prior to his presidency, Taylor was a career officer in the United States Army, rising to the rank of major general. His status as a national hero as a result of his victories in the Mexican-American War won him election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs. His top priority as president was preserving the Union, but he died sixteen months into his term, before making any progress on the status of slavery, which had been inflaming tensions in Congress.</p>
                <p>Taylor was born to a prominent family of planters who migrated westward from Virginia to Kentucky in his youth. He was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army in 1808 and made a name for himself as a captain in the War of 1812. He climbed the ranks establishing military forts along the Mississippi River and entered the Black Hawk War as a colonel in 1832. His success in the Second Seminole War attracted national attention and earned him the nickname "Old Rough and Ready".</p>
                <p>In 1845, as the annexation of Texas was underway, President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande area in anticipation of a potential battle with Mexico over the disputed Texas-Mexico border. The Mexican–American War broke out in May 1846, and Taylor led American troops to victory in a series of battles culminating in the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Monterrey. He became a national hero, and political clubs sprung up to draw him into the upcoming 1848 presidential election.</p>
                <p>The Whig Party convinced the reluctant Taylor to lead their ticket, despite his unclear platform and lack of interest in politics. He won the election alongside U.S. Representative Millard Fillmore of New York, defeating Democratic candidate Lewis Cass. As president, Taylor kept his distance from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened to divide the Union. Debate over the slave status of the large territories claimed in the war led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push for the expansion of slavery. To avoid the question, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850. Taylor died suddenly of a stomach-related illness in July 1850, ensuring he would have little impact on the sectional divide that led to civil war a decade later.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>Samuel Jones Tilden was born in 1814 in New York.  He studied law in New York and was admitted to the bar in 1841.   He soon became a successful lawyer and political leader.  In 1874 he was elected to serve as Governor of New York.  As governor, he fought corruption and broke up the “Canal Ring,” a scheme involving illegal contracts for work on the State’s canal system.  He also helped bring about the downfall of the infamous William “Boss” Tweed.</p>
<p>In 1876, Tilden became the Democratic nominee for president.  He ran against Republican Rutherford B. Hayes in what would become the most contested election in US history.  The election results in Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon were unclear, and so Congress assembled an Electoral Commission to decide who would win the disputed electoral college votes.  It is believed that Republicans and Southern Democrats made a deal in which they would support Hayes for president if he withdrew federal troops from the South and ended Reconstruction.  Although Tilden won the popular vote, Rutherford Hayes became president.  Tilden died on August 4, 1886.</p>

  <note type="org">Martin Van Buren (December 5, 1782 – July 24, 1862) was the eighth President of the United States (1837–1841). Before his presidency, he was the eighth Vice President (1833–1837) and the tenth secretary of state (1829–1831), both under Andrew Jackson.
Van Buren was a key organizer of the Democratic Party, a dominant figure in the Second Party System, and the first president not of British or Irish descent—his family was Dutch. He was the first president to have been born a United States citizen, since all of his predecessors were born British subjects before the American Revolution. He is the only president not to have spoken English as his first language, having grown up speaking Dutch, and the first president from New York.
As Andrew Jackson's Secretary of State and then Vice President, Van Buren was a key figure in building the organizational structure for Jacksonian democracy, particularly in New York. As president, he did not want the United States to annex Texas, an act which John Tyler would achieve eight years after Van Buren's initial rejection. Between the bloodless Aroostook War and the Caroline Affair, relations with Britain and its colonies in Canada also proved to be strained.
His administration was largely characterized by the economic hardship of his time, the Panic of 1837. He was scapegoated for the depression and called "Martin Van Ruin" by political opponents. Van Buren was voted out of office after four years, losing to Whig candidate William Henry Harrison. In the 1848 election Van Buren ran unsuccessfully for president on a third-party ticket, the Free Soil Party. Van Buren died fourteen years later at the age of seventy-nine.</note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003634">Vanderbilt, Cornelius, 1794-1877<orgName type="alt">Commodore Vanderbilt</orgName></orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Cornelius Vanderbilt was a successful steamship and railroad tycoon, one of the wealthiest men of the Gilded Age. Vanderbilt was born on Staten Island, one of many children of a modest farming family. To supplement the family income, Cornelius’s father, also Cornelius, ferried produce to Manhattan. Young Cornelius much preferred sailing to school or farming, and by the age of sixteen he had established his own ferry service, a business that expanded during the War of 1812. In 1813, Vanderbilt married his cousin, Sophia Johnson, and together the couple had thirteen children. Throughout the early years of the nineteenth-century, Vanderbilt expanded his boating enterprises and his fortune, entering the steamboat business by 1818 when he went to work for Thomas Gibbons running a service between New York and New Jersey and settling his family in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where Sophia ran a successful tavern. In 1829, with a capital of $30,000, he ventured out on his own to ply the Hudson River and Long Island Sound, competing successfully with steamboat established lines. By the late 1830s he was known as “Commodore” Vanderbilt and had a fortune of $1 million. In 1840, the Vanderbilts moved to a new mansion next to the old family farm on Staten Island. In the later 1840s, the family moved to Manhattan. It was during the 1840s, too, that Vanderbilt entered the railroad business, buying stock in several Long Island and New Jersey lines. In 1857 he became the director of the New York and Harlem Railroad, and he continued his acquisitions into the 1860s and 1870s. By 1865 he held a controlling interest in the Hudson River Railroad and was elected president. After a rate war with the New York Central Railroad, Vanderbilt acquired large quantities of its stock and became its director in 1867. In that same year he consolidated  the New York Central and the Hudson River Railroad, with himself as president. Sophia Vanderbilt died in 1868. The bereaved widower soon remarried, marrying a woman named Frank Crawford in August 1869. In 1871, Vanderbilt—at the instigation of his new wife—donated $1 million to found Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He also completed construction of Grand Central Depot in New York. By late 1876, Vanderbilt, now in his eighties, suffered a prolonged illness. He died at his New York City home on January 4, 1877, leaving a fortune of $100 million, mostly to his son William.</p></note>

He was the oldest son of Crown Prince Frederick and Victoria, the daughter of Great Britain’s Queen Victoria. In 1888, at the age of 29, he became the Kaiser or German emperor and two years later, forced the resignation of the chancellor, Otto von Bismarck.  William II strengthened the navy and military and strongly promoted German colonial expansion.</p>
                <p>In 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was assassinated in Sarajevo by a Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip.  In response, William II encouraged Austria to use its military might to strike against Serbia and assured Austria that Germany would support them in the event of war.  On July 28, 1914 Austria declared war on Serbia.  Soon after, the Triple Entente or Allies (Russia, United Kingdom, and France) entered into war against the Central powers of Austria and Germany.  The United States Congress declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917.</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of World War I, William II abdicated the throne and fled to the Netherlands.  The Allies unsuccessfully tried to extradite him and to put him on trial for war crimes.  He died on June 4, 1941.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>Woodrow Wilson was the twenty-eighth President of the United States.</p>
                <p>Wilson was born on December 28, 1856 in Virginia.  After graduating from Princeton University in 1879, Wilson studied law at the University of Virginia (1879-1873) and earned a Ph.D. in 1885 from Johns Hopkins University.  He became a professor and taught at Bryn Mawr College and Wesleyan University.  He married Ellen Louise Axson in 1885 and had three children.  She died in 1914.  Wilson later married Edith Bolling Galt in 1915. </p>
                <p>In 1890, Wilson began working at Princeton University as a professor.  Twelve years later, in 1902, he became President of Princeton University and put forth a $12.5 million program that would forever transform Princeton University.   In 1910, United States Senator, James Smith, Jr. and New York editor George Harvey convinced Wilson to run for governor of New Jersey on the democratic ticket.

As president, Wilson worked with Congress to pass several social and economic reforms such as the Federal Reserve Act, the Child Labor Reform Act, and the 19th amendment which granted women the right to vote.  Wilson led the nation during World War I and tried to establish the League of Nations.  He suffered a stroke in 1919 and died on February 3, 1924.</p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000002960">Woodhull, Victoria C. (Victoria Claflin), 1838-1927<orgName type="alt">Victoria California Claflin</orgName></orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Victoria Claflin Woodhull was perhaps the most sensational woman of early 1870s America. Born in 1838 in Homer, Ohio, Victoria was the seventh of ten children of Reuben and Roxanna Claflin. She experienced a poor and rootless childhood. At an early age she, with her younger sister Tennessee, became interested in spiritualism, and the sisters helped support their family with their psychic remedies for medical problems. Victoria married Canning Woodhull, a physician, in 1853, and had two children with him. She divorced Canning in 1865, who had become a drunkard and had drifted away, and in 1866 at least secured a marriage license to marry her lover, Col. James Harvey Blood, a Civil War veteran who had been one of her patients (no record of an actual ceremony exists). Woodhull, Blood, Tennessee Claflin, and other members of the Claflin family moved to New York City in 1868, where the sisters arranged a meeting with Cornelius Vanderbilt, the wealthy financier who shared their interest in spiritualism. Vanderbilt became the sisters’ financial advisor, and after some financial successes in late 1869, they launched their brokerage house in January 1870, becoming the first female stock brokers in the United States. Vanderbilt was almost certainly the silent partner in their firm, Woodhull, Claflin &amp; Co.</p>
                
                <p>By this time, Woodhull had also become involved in a number of reform causes, embracing Stephen Pearl Andrews’s idea of “Pantarchy,” which advocated a state in which property was commonly owned and free love replaced monogamous marriage. On April 2, 1870, Woodhull declared her candidacy for the presidency through a letter published in the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Herald</hi>. In May, she and Tennessee launched their own newspaper, <hi rendition="#italics">Woodhull &amp; Claflin’s Weekly</hi>, edited largely by Andrews and Blood. The paper combined columns on radical reform ideals along with financial news and muckraking journalism. By 1871, Woodhull became involved in the woman suffrage movement and was embraced by leaders such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. In January 1871 she became the first woman to testify before a congressional committee, speaking on behalf of the suffrage issue, arguing that women already had the right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. Suffrage leaders later distanced themselves from Woodhull, because of her radical views and controversial personal life. . In 1872, Woodhull was nominated for president by the newly organized Equal Rights Party, after losing the support of the National Woman Suffrage Association and its proposed People’s Party. By late 1872, Woodhull’s star was beginning to fall. She spent election day in jail for publishing and circulating through the mails, in violation of the Comstock Act, details of the beloved minister Henry Ward Beecher’s extramarital affair with Elizabeth Tilton in order to pressure Beecher to endorse free love. The backlash to her role in the Beecher scandal and to her own controversial lifestyle further isolated Woodhull. By 1876, she reversed her position on free love and distanced herself from spiritualism. She divorced Blood for adultery, and in 1877 left for England with Tennessee, her children, and other members of her family. There she married banker John Biddulph Martin in 1883 and lived a relatively conventional life. She published a journal on eugenics, lectured, and cultivated a respectable image. She died in Tewksbury in 1927.</p></note>
