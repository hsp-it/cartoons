        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit, featuring
          500 encoded political cartoons, that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
          provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact with
          historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the National
          Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and
          Documentary Editing program.></p>

            <label>Alligator</label>
            <note type="symbol"><p>During the 1820s, the alligator became associated with the
                presidential campaigns of Andrew Jackson and with Jacksonian Democracy in general.
                During the campaigns of 1824 and 1828, Jackson and his supporters used the popular
                song <ref target="http://www.loc.gov/teachers/lyrical/songs/docs/kentucky_trans.pdf"
                  >The Hunters of Kentucky; Or, Half Horse and Half Alligator"</ref> on the campaign
                trail. The song, alternately titled "The Battle of New Orleans" celebrated
                then-General Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812.
                The reference to the "half horse, half alligator" seems obscure now, but in the
                early national period, this semi-mythic creature was associated with Kentuckians and
                the rugged inhabitants of the Southwestern territories of the early United
                States.</p>
              <p>Ironically, although Jackson's candidacy was associated with the alligator symbol,
                Jackson's presidential rival, John Quincy Adams, actually kept a pet alligator,
                given to him by the Marquis de Lafayette, in a bathtub at the White
              House.</p></note>
