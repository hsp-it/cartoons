                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit, featuring 500 encoded political cartoons, that will
                    demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and
                    contextual materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in
                    new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the National Historical
                    Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and
                    Documentary Editing program.></p>

<item xml:id="alligator">
  <label>Alligator</label>
  <note type="symbol"><p>During the 1820s, the alligator became associated with the presidential campaigns of Andrew Jackson and with Jacksonian Democracy in general. During the campaigns of 1824 and 1828, Jackson and his supporters used the popular song <ref target="http://www.loc.gov/teachers/lyrical/songs/docs/kentucky_trans.pdf">The Hunters of Kentucky; Or, Half Horse and Half Alligator"</ref> on the campaign trail. The song, alternately titled "The Battle of New Orleans" celebrated then-General Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. The reference to the "half horse, half alligator" seems obscure now, but in the early national period, this semi-mythic creature was associated with Kentuckians and the rugged inhabitants of the Southwestern territories of the early United States.</p>
<p>Ironically, although Jackson's candidacy was associated with the alligator symbol, Jackson's presidential rival, John Quincy Adams, actually kept a pet alligator, given to him by the Marquis de Lafayette, in a bathtub at the White House.</p></note>

  <note type="symbol">Brother Jonathan was an early personification of the United States as a man and a precursor to <ref target="cartoons_people.xml#uncle_sam">Uncle Sam</ref>.  At first, he represented rural New England, but during the American Revolution he came to symbolize the colonies as well.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="bull_moose">

</item>
<item xml:id="columbia">
  <label>Columbia</label>
  <note type="symbol">Columbia is one of the most famous female personifications of America from the nation’s early days. Columbia is often depicted wearing classical robes and either wearing or holding a <ref target="cartoons_symbols.xml#liberty_cap">Phrygian or liberty cap</ref>. She is often drawn holding a sword and shield (sometimes decorated with the flag of the United States) and is frequently accompanied  by an American Bald Eagle. Columbia is often depicted as a motherly figure who chastises corrupt politicians. By the early 20th century, Columbia’s popularity declined as <ref target="cartoons_symbols.xml#uncle_sam">Uncle Sam</ref>’s increased, and following the completion of the <ref target="cartoons_symbols.xml#statue_of_liberty">Statue of Liberty</ref>, Liberty increasingly supplanted Columbia as the iconic female representation of the United States. </note>

  <note type="symbol">Dogs are often depicted in political cartoons as representatives of the press.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="donkey">
  <label>Donkey</label>
  <note type="symbol">Thomas Nast is often credited with debuting the donkey as the symbol for the Democratic Party in the late 19th century, but the association between donkeys and Democrats in political cartoons goes back at least to the 1828 campaign of Andrew Jackson. After his opponents insulted him by calling him a "jackass," Jackson proudly adopted the symbol of the strong-willed animal in their campaign iconography. Before and during the Civil War, cartoonists often represented seceding Southern states as stubborn donkeys. From the 1870s onward, Thomas Nast's cartoons did much to solidify and popularize the donkey as the symbol of the Democratic Party; he also used the donkey to represent the Democratic-supporting <hi rendition="#italics">New York Herald</hi> during the 1870s.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="dove">
  <label>Dove</label>
  <note type="symbol">The dove, often depicted holding an olive branch in its beak, is a symbol of peace.</note>

  <note type="symbol">The elephant is a symbol of the Republican Party. Thomas Nast is credited with popularizing the elephant as a Republican symbol in his cartoons from the 1870s.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="fame">
  <label>Fame</label>
  <note type="symbol">Personification of fame, often depicted as a winged goddess holding a laurel wreath and a trumpet. In Greek mythology, this goddess is called Pheme; in Roman mythology, Fama.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="fox">
  <label>Fox</label>
  <note type="symbol">Cartoonist Thomas Nast occasionally drew the fox as a symbol of the Democratic Party. In several cartoons in the Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) Project, artists drew actual foxes to represent men with the surname "Fox."</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="giraffe">
  <label>Giraffe</label>
  <note type="symbol">In the 1870s, Thomas Nast used the giraffe to represent the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Tribune</hi>. The <hi rendition="#italics">Tribune</hi>'s office building—under construction when Nast debuted his giraffe symbol—was tall and skinny, like the neck of a giraffe.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="jack_downing">
  <label>Jack Downing</label>
  <note type="symbol">A fictional character popularized in a serial newspaper narrative by author Seba Smith, Jack Downing (who, over the course of his adventures, rose to the rank of Major) appears frequently in American political cartoons from the early republic as a stand-in for the American everyman. In several cartoons, Jack Downing is depicted as a thin man wearing striped pants and a star-decorated waistcoat and either wearing or carrying a top hat, thus bearing a striking resemblance to <ref target="cartoons_symbols.xml#brother_jonathan">Brother Jonathan</ref> and his successor, <ref target="cartoons_symbols.xml#uncle_sam">Uncle Sam</ref>. Several of the cartoons in this exhibit bear the "signature" of Jack Downing's nephew, Zek Downing.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="john_bull">
  <label>John Bull</label>
  <note type="symbol">John Bull is a symbolic representation of Great Britain, often depicted as a heavy-set, middle-aged man. In cartoons published during the War of 1812, John Bull is often drawn to look like King George III or a British military officer; in some cases, John Bull appears as an actual bull with human characteristics.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="justice">
  <label>Justice</label>
  <note type="symbol">Justice is often depicted as a woman (the Roman goddess Justitia) wearing a blindfold (indicating that justice should be rendered impartially) and holding a set of scales (with which to weigh evidence) and a sword  (with which to execute a verdict). Although the sword, scales, and blindfold are all frequently associated with Justice, representations of the goddess do not always include all three elements.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="liberty_cap">
  <label>Liberty cap</label>
  <note type="symbol">Liberty caps, also sometimes called Phrygian caps, appear frequently in political cartoons. In ancient Rome, freed slaves wore pointed hats, with the peak bent or turned at the side or front, to indicate their status; thus, the Phrygian cap became a symbol of freedom. <rs ref="cartoons_symbols.xml#columbia">Columbia</rs>, the female personification of America, is often depicted wearing this type of cap, and many characters in American political cartoons are shown either wearing these caps or carrying poles decorated with liberty caps.<!-- do more research --></note>
</item>
<item xml:id="lion">
  <label>Lion</label>
  <note type="symbol">The lion appears on the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom and is often used as a symbol of Great Britain. American cartoonist Thomas Nast also drew  President Ulysses S. Grant as a lion.</note>

</item>
<item xml:id="rail">
  <label>Fence rail</label>
  <note type="symbol">Many political cartoons of the 1860s show Abraham Lincoln holding a fence rail, or refer to Lincoln as the "rail candidate." In his youth, before going into politics, Lincoln split rails and performed other difficult manual labor on the American frontier. When he campaigned for president in 1860, he and his supporters used the fence rail as a prop to remind voters of his humble origins and strong work ethic. At a Republican state convention in Illinois in 1860, Lincoln's supporters made a splash by dramatically marching into the hall carrying pieces of fence rail decorated with a pro-Lincoln banner, cementing Lincoln's near-mythical identity as "the rail splitter." Political cartoons of the era often invoked the image of the fence rail to symbolize Lincoln's candidacy.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="statue_of_liberty">
  <label>Statue of Liberty</label>
  <note type="symbol">The Statue of Liberty represents American liberty and is a 152-feet tall copper statue located in the New York Harbor. The statue was a gift from France to the United States. It was designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. President Grover Cleveland dedicated it on October 28, 1886. It became a national monument in 1924.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="tortoise">
  <label>Tortoise</label>
  <note type="symbol">In political cartoons of the 1820s-1840s, the tortoise was used to symbolize the Whig party. In the circa-1829 lithographed cartoon "A New Map of the United States..." John Quincy Adams and other Whigs are shown riding on the back of a gigantic tortoise.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="uncle_sam">
  <label>Uncle Sam</label>
  <note type="symbol">Uncle Sam is a fictional character and a symbol of the United States. He often wears a top hat and striped pants. The character of Uncle Sam first appeared during the War of 1812 and, according to popular belief, was named after Samuel Wilson, a government meat inspector during the War of 1812. Although the character of Uncle Sam has been around since the beginning of the 19th century, he didn’t begin to eclipse <ref target="cartoons_symbols.xml#columbia">Columbia</ref> in popularity until the 20th century. <ref target="cartoons_symbols.xml#brother_jonathan">Brother Jonathan</ref> (and, to some extent, the fictional character <ref target="cartoons_symbols.xml#jack_downing">Jack Downing</ref>) is considered a precursor to Uncle Sam.</note>
</item>
<item xml:id="unicorn">
  <label>Unicorn</label>
  <note type="symbol">The unicorn is a symbol used in Britain's coat of arms, and is sometimes used to symbolize Great Britain. In the 1870s, Thomas Nast also used a unicorn wearing a monocle to represent the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Times</hi>, whose editor was English.</note>
