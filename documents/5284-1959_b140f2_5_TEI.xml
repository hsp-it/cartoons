        <p>The Greenfield Digital Project interprets the story of Bankers Trust Company, a large
          Philadelphia bank that failed in 1930, through a selection of primary source documents,
          contextual essays, and teacher resources. The project is part of a larger effort funded by
          the Albert M. Greenfield Foundation to make HSP's 20th-century holdings more
          accessible.</p>

          Level 4 of "Best Practices for TEI in Libraries" guidelines v3.0.</p>
        <p>We have generally encoded entire documents/texts, not excerpts. We have encoded page
          breaks. We have also preserved original spelling, typographical errors, missing text, and
          original capitalization. For clippings from newspapers or other publications, we have
          transcribed just the text related to the article, ignoring other text or markings on the
          page that were purposefully or inadvertently included during clipping. We have regularized
          spacing between words and sentences to replace double (or triple) spaces to a single
          space.</p>
        <p>We have not coded line breaks, end-of-line hyphenation, visual rendition of layout, font

          <salute>To our Depositors and Customers:</salute></opener>

        <p>I desire to add this personal word to the <ref target="5284-1959_b140f2_6_TEI.xml">letter
            of this date</ref> which I have joined with <persName
            ref="Greenfield_project_people.xml#Barker_Samuel">Mr. Barker</persName> in addressing to
            you.<note type="editorial" n="1">On this same date, Lewis also sent <ref
              target="5284-1959_b140f2_7_TEI.xml">a letter to stockholders</ref> of Bank of
            Philadelphia and Trust Company.</note></p>

        <p>It has been my desire for a considerable period of time to see our bank consolidated with
            <orgName ref="Greenfield_project_organizations.xml#Bankers_Trust">Bankers Trust
            Company</orgName>. It has made notable progress under the leadership of Mr. Barker. He
          has associated with him a splendid corps of experienced men, and has established
          exceptionally fine contacts with the business interests of the <sic>City</sic>. I feel
          that association with such strong banking interests is of real value to our customers.</p>

        <p>Coupled with this is the fact that Bankers Trust Company believes, as we do, in branch
            banking<sic>, -</sic> a strong central organization, but with every facility made easily
          available in each community. We now have nineteen offices, including all of the nine
          offices which Bank of Philadelphia has maintained. They will be strengthened by
          consolidation with <sic>them of branches</sic> heretofore maintained by Bankers Trust
          Company.</p>

        <p>This enlargement of the institution will not mean that you will lose contact with the men
          with whom you have been accustomed to do business. You will find all your old friends
          here, and some new ones, who are anxious to become acquainted with you and to serve you.
          There has been created the <orgName
            ref="Greenfield_project_organizations.xml#North_Phila_Advisory_Board">North Philadelphia
            Advisory Board</orgName>, upon which all directors of Bank of Philadelphia will serve.
          This will assure intimate and cordial consideration for the established business
          associations which we have developed with our depositors and other customers.</p>

        <p>It is with great confidence in our ability to serve you in every field of banking,
          investment, title and trust business, that I ask for your continued patronage and
          friendship.</p>

        <closer><salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
