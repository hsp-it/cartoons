                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

In the first section, a mob of Americans attack a group of European immigrants who have just arrived in New York City and are passing through the Castle Garden immigrant station.  In the background, there are ships and a sign labeled "Castle Garden". A woman wearing a scarf and carrying a trunk watches in horror as men throw stones and punches.  A man carrying a parcel and a large bag has blood coming out from his eye.  In the second section, a group of Chinese immigrants, wearing conical hats and long braids have just arrived in San Francisco, and are riding in a wagon. Americans throw stones at them and try to pull them from the wagon.  One man pulls the braid of an immigrant.</p>

Southwest Battery, as it was first called, was constructed between 1808 and 1811 and was used as a fort to defend against the British during the War of 1812.  In 1823, it was renamed Castle Garden and became an opera house and theater  From 1855 to 1890, Castle Garden served as an immigrant processing center and over 8 million immigrants passed through its doors.  Today it is known as Castle Clinton National Monument.</note></p>

                <p>The cartoon depicts a man pulling an immigrant's braid.  Under the Manchu Dynasty, Chinese men were required by law to wear a queue or long braid.   Men who cut off the queue would be imprisioned or killed. Because many immigrants planned to return to China, they did not cut off their queue.  Many whites, however, considered the hairstyle uncivilized and unhygienic. </p>
