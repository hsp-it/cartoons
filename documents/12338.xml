                            mostly through donations and purchases of individual prints. It also

                            Institute for Ethnic Studies. Some of the 20th century cartoons and
                            drawings were removed from the J. Hampton Moore papers (Collection
                            1541)."</acquisition>

                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

            <div type="editorial_desc">
                <p>Men driving carriages labeled "Freedmen's Bureau," "Civil Rights," and
                    "Reconstruction" find their road blocked by a large log labeled "Veto." In front
                    of the roadblock stands US president Andrew Johnson, who in 1865 vetoed the
                    Civil Rights Act (it eventually passed in spite of his veto) and pardoned former
                    Confederates who swore allegiance to the United States. In 1866, Johnson also
                    vetoed an updated version of a bill to authorize the Freedmen's Bureau, which
                    was established in 1865 to aid and protect the rights of freed slaves. Johnson,
                    standing at the center of the image, is depicted with donkey ears. He describes
                    the carriage drivers as "Radical Republicans" and shakes the hand of a man he
                    has pardoned for counterfeiting. At left, former Confederate soldiers shake
                    their fists at the men driving the carriages as they boast of killing Union
                    officers during the Civil War, threaten to whip and collar the Northerners, and
                    declare loyalty to Johnson. Vice president William Seward, standing behind the
                    Johnson, pours whiskey for the Southerners. At right, Emperor Napoleon III of
                    France puts his arm around John Bull, symbolizing Great Britain, and expresses
                    admiration for Johnson. Boxes of pardons and political appointments for
                    Southerners stand at Napoleon and John Bull's feet. Behind the roadblock, the
                    carriage drivers discuss ancient Roman tribunes, elected representatives of the
                    people's rights. This cartoon criticizes Johnson's leniency toward the South in
                    the aftermath of the Civil War, which many Northerners viewed as a betrayal, and
                    his opposition to Radical Republican goals of assisting former slaves and
                    ensuring equal rights for Americans, regardless of race.</p>
