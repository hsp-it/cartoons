        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>Men driving carriages labeled "Freedmen's Bureau," "Civil Rights," and "Reconstruction"
          find their road blocked by a large log labeled "Veto." In front of the roadblock stands US
          president Andrew Johnson, who in 1865 vetoed the Civil Rights Act (it eventually passed in
          spite of his veto) and pardoned former Confederates who swore allegiance to the United
          States. In 1866, Johnson also vetoed an updated version of a bill to authorize the
          Freedmen's Bureau, which was established in 1865 to aid and protect the rights of freed
          slaves. Johnson, standing at the center of the image, is depicted with donkey ears. He
          describes the carriage drivers as "Radical Republicans" and shakes the hand of a man he
          has pardoned for counterfeiting. At left, former Confederate soldiers shake their fists at
          the men driving the carriages as they boast of killing Union officers during the Civil
          War, threaten to whip and collar the Northerners, and declare loyalty to Johnson. Vice
          president William Seward, standing behind the Johnson, pours whiskey for the Southerners.
          At right, Emperor Napoleon III of France puts his arm around John Bull, symbolizing Great
          Britain, and expresses admiration for Johnson. Boxes of pardons and political appointments
          for Southerners stand at Napoleon and John Bull's feet. Behind the roadblock, the carriage
          drivers discuss ancient Roman tribunes, elected representatives of the people's rights.
          This cartoon criticizes Johnson's leniency toward the South in the aftermath of the Civil
          War, which many Northerners viewed as a betrayal, and his opposition to Radical Republican
          goals of assisting former slaves and ensuring equal rights for Americans, regardless of
          race.</p>
