        <p>The Greenfield Digital Project interprets the story of Bankers Trust Company, a large
          Philadelphia bank that failed in 1930, through a selection of primary source documents,
          contextual essays, and teacher resources. The project is part of a larger effort funded by
          the Albert M. Greenfield Foundation to make HSP's 20th-century holdings more
          accessible.</p>

          Level 4 of "Best Practices for TEI in Libraries" guidelines v3.0.</p>
        <p>We have generally encoded entire documents/texts, not excerpts. We have encoded page
          breaks. We have also preserved original spelling, typographical errors, missing text, and

          transcribed just the text related to the article, ignoring other text or markings on the
          page that were purposefully or inadvertently included during clipping. We have regularized
          spacing between words and sentences to replace double (or triple) spaces to a single
          space.</p>
        <p>We have not coded line breaks, end-of-line hyphenation, visual rendition of layout, font

          <persName ref="Greenfield_project_people.xml#Greenfield_Albert">Mr. Albert M.
            Greenfield</persName> Walnut and Juniper Streets Philadelphia, Pa.<salute>Dear Mr.
            Greenfield:</salute></opener>

        <p>There is a matter in connection with the <orgName
            ref="Greenfield_project_organizations.xml#Womens_Medical_College">Women's Medical
            College</orgName> which needs no action at the present time, but of which I think it
          well to inform you as you may be able to do something regarding it in the future.</p>

        <p>You have already been somewhat in touch with the situation in reference to the buildings
          on N. College Avenue and no doubt with an institution of this kind, you may in the future
          be consulted or interested in some of its various angles. The Finance Committee consists
          of <persName ref="Greenfield_project_people.xml#Ritter_Sheldon">Mr. Sheldon P.
            Ritter</persName>, <persName ref="Greenfield_project_people.xml#Middleton_Clara">Miss
            Clara Middleton</persName>, <persName ref="Greenfield_project_people.xml#Gates_Jay">Mr.
            Jay Gates</persName>, <persName ref="Greenfield_project_people.xml#Starr_Mrs_James">Mrs.
            James Starr</persName>, and <rs ref="Greenfield_project_people.xml#Smith_Ely"
            >myself</rs>. The <orgName
            ref="Greenfield_project_organizations.xml#Pennsylvania Company">Pennsylvania
            Company</orgName>, at the present time, <sic>is fiscal agent</sic>. This is mainly due
          to the fact that they made a temporary loan of $100,000 secured by a mortgage upon the N.
          College Avenue buildings several years ago. They hold in their Trust Department endowment
          funds of the college and hospital amounting, at the present time, to about $800,000. They
          are paid $500 a year for clerical work in handling this fund, which is an inadequate
          payment for the work involved. With the building of the new hospital in Germantown and the
          growing activity of the institution, there will be more funds of various kinds to handle
          including a larger current bank account.</p>

        <p>As you are probably aware, there is a very active group of people connected with this
          institution, who could be very useful friends of the Bankers Trust Company. They do not
          mean so much to the Pennsylvania Company, but they would mean a lot to us. Furthermore, if
          we could get the endowment funds transferred to us, it would swell our Trust
            <sic>fund</sic> figures considerably. It may or may not be necessary to take over the
          $100,000 loan. That may solve itself in the sale of the College Avenue buildings.</p>

        <p>My thought in writing to you is to give you the entire picture to keep in mind so when
          the occasion arises when you have any dealings with <persName
