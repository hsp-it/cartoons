        <p>The Greenfield Digital Project interprets the story of Bankers Trust Company, a large
          Philadelphia bank that failed in 1930, through a selection of primary source documents,
          contextual essays, and teacher resources. The project is part of a larger effort funded by
          the Albert M. Greenfield Foundation to make HSP's 20th-century holdings more
          accessible.</p>

          Level 4 of "Best Practices for TEI in Libraries" guidelines v3.0.</p>
        <p>We have generally encoded entire documents/texts, not excerpts. We have encoded page
          breaks. We have also preserved original spelling, typographical errors, missing text, and
          original capitalization. For clippings from newspapers or other publications, we have
          transcribed just the text related to the article, ignoring other text or markings on the
          page that were purposefully or inadvertently included during clipping. We have regularized
          spacing between words and sentences to replace double (or triple) spaces to a single
          space.</p>
        <p>We have not coded line breaks, end-of-line hyphenation, visual rendition of layout, font

            n="1">Writing to Greenfield at his home rather than his business address, Reeve appears to
            be soliciting Greenfield as a potential customer, though he certainly would have known
            of Greenfield's professional involvement in Bankers Trust.</note>
          <salute>Dear Mr. Greenfield:</salute></opener>

        <p>The Trust Department of your Company has, in the past two years, grown from nothing to
          over $2,500,000. and has many millions of future business in its vaults. In these results
          are included business from only five of our thirty-seven directors.</p>

        <p>We, in the management, feel that the Trust Department can be of real service to you,
          either immediately or in the future, and see no reason why you should hesitate to entrust
          your affairs to the Company.</p>

        <p>The writer would like very much to have the opportunity of discussing personally with you
          the many ways in which the Trust Department can serve you. An interview in the near future
          would be appreciated.<note type="editorial" n="2">Greenfield <ref
