                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

            <div type="editorial_desc">
                <p>This political cartoon is divided into two scenes depicting events in 1832 and in
                    1864, when this cartoon was published. In the left-hand panel, labeled "1832,"
                    US President Andrew Jackson, standing on a platform to the right of the panel in
                    military uniform, is shown raging at John Calhoun, who bows before Jackson and
                    begs for mercy. The right-hand panel, labeled "1864," shows US presidential
                    candidate George B. McClellan and his running mate, George Pendleton, groveling
                    before Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Davis, standing at the left of the
                    frame, dressed in ragged clothing and holding a whip under his arm, looks down
                    on McClellan and Pendleton as Jackson looks down on Calhoun in the opposite
                    panel. He demands that McClellan and Pendleton call back Union military heroes
                    Sherman, Grant, Sheridan, and Farragut. To the right of the panel, McClellan and
                    Pendleton kneel on a platform labeled "Chicago Platform" and extend an olive
                    branch, a symbol of peace, to Davis. Behind Davis, two Confederate soldiers, one
                    eating a corn cob, remark on McClellan and Pendleton's stupidity.</p>
                <p>During the Nullification Crisis of 1832, South Carolina, citing states' rights,
                    threatened to secede from the United States if the federal government attempted
                    to collect tariff duties. South Carolinian John Calhoun, who supported
                    nullification, resigned his position as vice president of the United States to
                    join South Carolina's senate. Jackson considered South Carolina's actions
                    treasonous and sent ships and soldiers to enforce the tariff measures. In this
                    cartoon, Jackson is shown as a strong leader, tough on treason, and dedicated to
                    preserving the Union, much like Abraham Lincoln, who was running against
                    McClellan during the presidential election of 1864. In contrast, McClellan, who
                    ran on a platform of "peace at any price," is depicted as weak and cowardly
                    character. Rather than standing up to traitors who threaten the Union, he kneels
                    before the leader of the Confederacy and promises to give him whatever he
                    wants.</p>

                <p>CHICAGO PLATFORM</p>
                <note n="1">"Chicago platform," here depicted as a physical platform, is a reference
                    to the position adopted by the Democratic National Convention of 1864. The party
                    at the time was split between "War Democrats," who supported the Union's
                    military efforts against the Confederacy in the Civil War, and "Peace
                    Democrats," who hoped to negotiate peace with the Confederacy. At the
                    convention, <persName key="ENT.000001783">George McClellan</persName>, a Union
                    general and a War Democrat, was chosen as the party's presidential nominee and
                        <persName key="ENT.000003373">George Pendleton</persName>, who had opposed
                    the war, as his running mate. The convention also voted to formally adopt a
                    peace platform, a platform that McClellan himself did not agree with.</note>
