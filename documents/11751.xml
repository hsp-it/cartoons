        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

      <div type="editorial_desc">
        <p>This political cartoon is divided into two scenes depicting events in 1832 and in 1864,
          when this cartoon was published. In the left-hand panel, labeled "1832," US President
          Andrew Jackson, standing on a platform to the right of the panel in military uniform, is
          shown raging at John Calhoun, who bows before Jackson and begs for mercy. The right-hand
          panel, labeled "1864," shows US presidential candidate George B. McClellan and his running
          mate, George Pendleton, groveling before Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Davis,
          standing at the left of the frame, dressed in ragged clothing and holding a whip under his
          arm, looks down on McClellan and Pendleton as Jackson looks down on Calhoun in the
          opposite panel. He demands that McClellan and Pendleton call back Union military heroes
          Sherman, Grant, Sheridan, and Farragut. To the right of the panel, McClellan and Pendleton
          kneel on a platform labeled "Chicago Platform" and extend an olive branch, a symbol of
          peace, to Davis. Behind Davis, two Confederate soldiers, one eating a corn cob, remark on
          McClellan and Pendleton's stupidity.</p>
        <p>During the Nullification Crisis of 1832, South Carolina, citing states' rights,
          threatened to secede from the United States if the federal government attempted to collect
          tariff duties. South Carolinian John Calhoun, who supported nullification, resigned his
          position as vice president of the United States to join South Carolina's senate. Jackson
          considered South Carolina's actions treasonous and sent ships and soldiers to enforce the
          tariff measures. In this cartoon, Jackson is shown as a strong leader, tough on treason,
          and dedicated to preserving the Union, much like Abraham Lincoln, who was running against
          McClellan during the presidential election of 1864. In contrast, McClellan, who ran on a
          platform of "peace at any price," is depicted as weak and cowardly character. Rather than
          standing up to traitors who threaten the Union, he kneels before the leader of the
          Confederacy and promises to give him whatever he wants.</p>

          position adopted by the Democratic National Convention of 1864. The party at the time was
          split between "War Democrats," who supported the Union's military efforts against the
          Confederacy in the Civil War, and "Peace Democrats," who hoped to negotiate peace with the
          Confederacy. At the convention, <persName key="ENT.000001783">George McClellan</persName>,
          a Union general and a War Democrat, was chosen as the party's presidential nominee and
            <persName key="ENT.000003373">George Pendleton</persName>, who had opposed the war, as
          his running mate. The convention also voted to formally adopt a peace platform, a platform
