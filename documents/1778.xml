        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>In this political cartoon, which comments Andrew Jackson's removal of federal funds from
          the Bank of the United States, President Jackson is drawn as a pig with a human head,
          wearing one boot, roasting on a stove labeled "The Purifying Furnace of Public Opinion."
          Behind the barbecue stand five men, three of whom comment on the barbecue. Various
          historians have identified these men as Nicholas Biddle, William B. Preston, Daniel
          Webster, Henry Clay, and an unidentified fifth man. At right, Justice stands and holds the
          roasting rack steady, while Jack Downing (a popular character in a newspaper serial)
          kneels and splits kindling wood to feed the fire. At left, William Duane, former Secretary
          of the Treasury, leans down to stoke the fire, and a devil runs away. Numerous versions of
          this cartoon exist, some with the image reversed. In some versions of this cartoon, the
          devil has the face of Martin Van Buren, and all five men standing behind the barbecue
          speak. H. R. Robinson and Ezra Bisbee are both known to have published variants of this
          cartoon, but the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's copy of this image differs from
          theirs. Therefore, the publisher of this cartoon is as yet unknown.</p>
