              through donations and purchases of individual prints. It also incorporates previously
              uncataloged materials collected by the Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies. Some of the
              20th century cartoons and drawings were removed from the J. Hampton Moore papers

        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

      <div type="editorial_desc">
        <p>In the "Before" panel on the left, a smiling, well-dressed African American man holds a
          ballot before his face, putting a finger to his mouth in a gesture that suggests
          contemplation. A white person wearing a dress labeled "Southern Democracy" kneels beside
          him, looking up, smiling, and declaring "I am your best friend. I love you!" The
          Southerner is drawn as a figure of ambiguous gender, sporting a masculine goatee but also
          a stereotypically feminine dress (a long gown) and physical features (breasts and long
          hair, styled in a bun and braid). A four-tailed whip, labeled "The lost cause," pokes out
          of the Southerner's dress pocket. The caption for this panel warns "She is fooling thee!
          Trust her not!" In the "After" panel on the right, the African American man is running
          away from the Southerner, who swings the whip toward him and shouts angry epithets, while
          stomping on a piece of paper labeled "Colored Men's Rights" and gripping another piece of
          paper (perhaps the ballot from the previous panel) tightly, crumpling it. Although the
          Southerner is still drawn with some stereotypically feminine features, the dress has been
          replaced by a pair of stereotypically masculine trousers, and the braid from the previous
          panel has been replaced by a chain. The accompanying caption asks "Will You Love Me Then
          as Now?" Overall, this cartoon comments on black voting rights in the Reconstruction South
          and attempts to curtail these rights.</p>
        <p>The captions for the two cartoon's two panels reference popular songs that readers in the
          1860s would have recognized. "She is fooling thee! Trust her not!" is a lyric from a song
          called "Beware," which warns of "a maiden fair to see" who "can both false and friendly
          be." "Will You Love Me Then as Now" is the title of a sentimental song originally
          published in 1853. "The Lost Cause" was the title of a book about the Civil War originally
          published by a Southern historian in 1866; the idea of the lost cause came to be
          associated with sadness over the Confederacy's defeat in the Civil War as well as
          nostalgia for the "old" way of life in the pre-war South, before slavery was abolished and
          black men were able to vote. This cartoon is unsigned, so the artist cannot be identified
          definitively. However, we know that Thomas Nast was a regular anonymous contributor to <hi
            rendition="#italics">Phunny Phellow</hi>, and so HINT Project staff have tagged him as a
          (potential) artist for this cartoon.</p>
