                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

                <p>Grover Cleveland is the only president elected to serve two non-consecutive
                    terms. He defeated Republican candidate James Blaine in 1884 and became the 22nd
                    president. In 1888, Cleveland lost the presidency to Republican Benjamin
                    Harrison although he had won the popular vote. In 1892, Cleveland ran for third
                    time and defeated Harrison.</p>
                <p>In the political cartoon, Democratic candidate Grover Cleveland and his running
                    mate Adlai Stevenson swim in the "presidential sea." John Bull, the symbol for
                    Great Britain, and William F. Harrity, chairman of the Democratic National
                    Committee and Cleveland's campaign manager, are in a small boat. They call out
                    to Cleveland and Stevenson. In the background there are several icebergs
                    threatening Cleveland's re-election campaign. The icebergs are labeled "mock
                    civil service reform, Cleveland speeches, free trade," and "Tammany". During his
                    first term as president (1884-1888), Cleveland supported civil service reform,
                    but his critics argued that his reforms did not go far enough. He also opposed
                    the New York Democratic machine, Tammany Hall, whose support he needed to win
                    the election. Furthermore, as president he unsuccessfully attempted to pass
                    legislation to lower tariffs. Tariff reform became a central issue during the
                    1888 presidential election, and ultimately, his support of free trade led him to
                    lose the 1888 election to Harrison.</p>

                <p>Cleveland became the 22nd and 24th President of the United States. He supported
                    the gold currency, civil service reform, and free trade. After his presidency,

                <p>Adlai Stevenson was a congressman from Illinois. Cleveland supported the gold

                    free silver, as his vice presidential running mate.</p>
