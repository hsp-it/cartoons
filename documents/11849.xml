                            mostly through donations and purchases of individual prints. It also
                            incorporates previously uncataloged materials collected by the Balch
                            Institute for Ethnic Studies. Some of the 20th century cartoons and
                            drawings were removed from the J. Hampton Moore papers (Collection
                            1541).</acquisition>

                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

                <p>This cartoon, clipped from <hi rendition="#italics">Harper's Weekly</hi>, depicts
                    a family scene. At right, a bearded man in military uniform sits down in an
                    armchair and regards his children. His hat is on his knee and his knapsack and
                    rifle are on the ground beside him. At left, a young boy, Bubby, holds a boot
                    jack, wordlessly offering to help his father remove his boots; a young girl, the
                    man's daughter, stands behind Bubby. Behind them, their mother stands at a
                    table, pouring tea into cups. The father tells his son he won't take his boots
                    off because he only has time to drink a cup of tea before returning to the
                    military. The title "The Three Months Volunteer at Home" likely references the
                    fact that militia volunteers could not legally be compelled to serve for more
                    than three months out of the year.</p>
