                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

                <p>Baseball serves as a metaphor for the presidential election of <date when="1860"
                        >1860</date>, in this cartoon, which provides a prime example of sports
                    metaphors in politics. Successful candidate Abraham Lincoln, standing at home
                    base, has scored a run, while unsuccessful presidential candidates John Bell,
                    Stephen A. Douglas, and John C. Breckinridge have struck out, and Breckinridge
                    has been sprayed by a skunk. Each of the players wears a belt emblazoned with
                    the name of his team; instead of the names of actual baseball clubs from the
                    1860s, however, these are team names that reflect their political goals and
                    personalities. Each also holds a bat labeled with a phrase that hints at their
                    policies and tactics (instead of a baseball bat, Lincoln holds a fence rail).
                    This pro-Lincoln cartoon implies that Lincoln's bat, labeled "Equal Rights and
                    Free Territory," and his "team" of supporters, the "Wide Awakes," ensure his
                    victory in the game, as well as in the election.</p>

                <p>In 1860s baseball, "skunked" meant that one team was so far ahead in score that
                    there was no way for the other team to win. The "skunk rule," more commonly
                    called the "mercy rule" today, allowed the game to end.</p>
