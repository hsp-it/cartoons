              through donations and purchases of individual prints. It also incorporates previously
              uncataloged materials collected by the Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies. Some of the
              20th century cartoons and drawings were removed from the J. Hampton Moore papers
              (Collection 1541).</acquisition>

        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>At the right of the page, Confederate president Jefferson Davis, disguised in women's
          clothing, is shown running away from soldiers of the US Army. Davis is wearing a dress,
          and a woman's bonnet, attached to his neck by a ribbon, has just fallen off of his head;
          underneath the dress, he is wearing men's riding boots with spurs. He holds a sack of gold
          under his right arm and clutches a dagger in his right hand. In pursuit are four Union
          soldiers with swords and pistols drawn. They call out to Davis to surrender, telling him
          that they see through his disguise. Davis, still pretending to be a woman, cries out "Let
          me alone, you bloodthirsty villains: I thought your government more magnanimous than to
          hunt down women and children!" Behind Davis, a Confederate woman tries to defend the
          Confederate president against the Union soldiers, telling them "Look out, you vile
          Yankees, if you make him mad, he will hurt some of you!" This cartoon is a sensationalized
          depiction of the capture of Jefferson Davis on the morning of May 10, 1865, near
          Irwinville, Georgia. Following his capture, rumors circulated that Davis had been found
          attempting to escape while disguised as a woman. According to Davis, as the troops closed
          in he had hurriedly put on the first coat he could find (his wife's raincoat), and his
          wife threw her shawl over his head for further protection. Cartoonists seized on the
          opportunity to make fun of the former president of the Confederacy by portraying him
          masquerading in full female dress, complete with hoop skirts, petticoats, and bonnets.</p>
