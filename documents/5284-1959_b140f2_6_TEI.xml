        <p>The Greenfield Digital Project interprets the story of Bankers Trust Company, a large
          Philadelphia bank that failed in 1930, through a selection of primary source documents,
          contextual essays, and teacher resources. The project is part of a larger effort funded by
          the Albert M. Greenfield Foundation to make HSP's 20th-century holdings more
          accessible.</p>

          spacing between words and sentences to replace double (or triple) spaces to a single

        <p>We are pleased to join in announcing that Bankers Trust Company and <orgName

            Company</orgName>, by unanimous vote of the directors of both Banks, have consolidated
          to establish greater banking facilities.<note type="editorial" n="1">Lewis also sent a
            letter on this date to <ref target="5284-1959_b140f2_7_TEI.xml">stockholders</ref> of
            Bank of Philadelphia and Trust Company, as well as a <ref

            customers" explaining why he thought the consolidation made sense.</note> Both banks
          have worked to establish in each neighborhood center where located, the services of a
          strong financial institution.</p>

        <p>The consolidated institution will maintain 19 offices. It has over $50,000,000. of
          deposits and resources of about $60,000,000.</p>

        <p>We are glad to welcome into this greater institution, - BANKERS TRUST COMPANY OF
          PHILADELPHIA, - all our customers and their friends. You may continue to use your present
          check book until such time as it is convenient for you to have us furnish you with a new
          one.</p>

        <p>The official families of both institutions are now welded into one strong organization,
          and our officers will welcome the opportunity of personally meeting our depositors. You
          may confidently expect hearty welcome, careful attention, ready service and every regard
          for your interest and welfare.</p>
