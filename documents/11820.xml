        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>A frowning African American man, likely a veteran of the Union Army, sits atop a stele
          (an inscribed monument), with a rifle at his feet, a bag labeled "US," at his side, a
          scroll with the words "Emancipated by A. Lincoln" resting on his knee, and broken chains
          hanging around him. The inscription of the monument he sits upon, however, lists the
          violence and abuses African Americans suffered under slavery and continue to suffer in the
          era of Reconstruction. The monument text includes racist statements made by Democratic
          politicians running for office in the upcoming 1868 election. At the base of the monument,
          an African American woman, clutching an infant to her chest, lies dead, a pool of blood
          spreading from her head. The bloodied and lifeless body of a young African American child
          lies beside her. On either side of the monument can be seen scenes of white violence
          against African Americans. On the right, details from the New York City Draft Riots of
          1863 are depicted, including the burning of the Colored Orphan's Asylum,the hanging of an
          African American man from a lamppost, and a white man brandishing a billy club. On the
          right, southern violence against freedpeople and their institutions is shown: a Freedman's
          School burns in the background, a lynched body hangs from a tree, and a masked member of
          the Ku Klux Klan brandishes a pistol. The title "Patience on a Monument" is a reference to
          a line from Shakespeare's <hi rendition="#italics">Twelfth Night</hi>, describing a woman
          who "sat like Patience on a Monument, smiling at Grief." Our copy of this powerful cartoon
          by Thomas Nast is from a supplement to the <hi rendition="#italics">Cincinnati
            Gazette</hi>; the image was also published in <hi rendition="#italics">Harper's
            Weekly</hi> in the October 10, 1868, issue.</p>

        <head>Violence in the North</head>
        <p>The backdrop to the left side of the monument depicts racially motivated violence against
          African Americans during the New York City Draft Riots of <date from="1863-07-13"
            to="1863-07-16">July 13-16, 1863</date>. White mobs who began by protesting the draft
          during the Civil War quickly ended up attacking black men, women, and children and
          vandalizing many their homes and businesses. The bodies of a lynching victim hanging from
          a lamppost and the bodies shown lying in the street are references to the more than 100
          African Americans killed during the riots. The burning building in this cartoon is the
