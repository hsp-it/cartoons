        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>This cartoon celebrates the American victory against the British at Fort McHenry during
          the War of 1812. It depicts members of the US 5th Regiment, at left, chasing off British
          and Scottish troops at right. One American soldier bayonets the bottom of "John Bull," an
          anthropomorphic bull wearing human clothes and a hat, who represents Great Britain. In the
          background, an American rifleman shoots from the bushes at a mounted Scottish general.
          Fort McHenry can be seen in the distance at left. "John Bull and the Baltimoreans" is a
          sequel to another cartoon by William Charles titled "John Bull and the Alexandrians." That
          cartoon showed John Bull dictating terms of surrender to the inhabitants of Alexandria,
          Virginia. In contrast, this cartoon shows the inhabitants of Baltimore, Maryland, turning
          the tables on the British.</p>
