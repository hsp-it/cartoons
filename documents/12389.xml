                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

            <div type="editorial_desc">
                <p>This illustration in the <hi rendition="#italics">Pennsylvania Gazette</hi>,
                    published by Benjamin Franklin, is widely regarded as the first American
                    political cartoon. In this image, Franklin uses the image of a snake cut into
                    eight pieces to make a political point—that American colonists from the 13
                    colonies, who often squabbled among one another—needed to unite to defend
                    themselves against violence that threatened them all. The context for this
                    cartoon was the outbreak of hostilities between France and Britain and their
                    respective Native American allies in North America. This conflict is often
                    called the French and Indian War in the United States, although the fighting in
                    North America was only one theater of a worldwide conflict known as the Seven
                    Years' War. In an editorial column, Franklin reported on Iroquois attacks
                    against British colonists and warned that if the colonists did not agree to
                    present a united front at the upcoming Albany Conference more violence would
                    ensue. To illustrate his point, he added in an engraved image of a snake cut
                    into pieces, each labeled with an abbreviation for a specific colony. Actually,
                    this image cheats a little. Instead of showing a snake cut into 13 pieces—one
                    for each colony—the colonies that made up New England are combined into one
                    segment—the snake's head—labeled "N. E." The other pieces of the snake are
                    labeled "N.Y." (New York), "N. J." (New Jersey), P. (Pennsylvania), M.
                    (Maryland), V. (Virginia), N. C. (North Carolina), and the tail is labeled "S.
                    C." (South Carolina). The slogan accompanying the image, "Join, or Die,"
                    referenced the superstition that a snake that had been cut in half could come
                    back to life if it could rejoin the pieces of its body before the sun set. This
                    simple image contained several clear and powerful messages: although the
                    colonists were divided, they had the chance to save themselves if they joined
                    together. But time was short; if they failed to unite, the consequences could be
                    fatal.</p>
                <p>This cartoon enjoyed instant popularity, and images of cut-up snakes were quickly
                    republished in newspapers in New York and Boston. Much like modern-day internet
                    memes, people who shared this image did not always copy it exactly as it had
                    originally appeared, but often made changes to the image or the caption to
                    appeal to their audience. For instance, when this cartoon ran in the <hi
                        rendition="#italics">Boston Gazette</hi>, the caption was changed to "Unite
                    and Conquer." Well after the Seven Years' War had ended, Franklin's snake became
                    a symbol of colonial unity against controversial British policies when Paul
                    Revere published his own version of "Join, or Die" during the Stamp Act crisis.
                    It remained a popular pro-colonist symbol throughout the American Revolution and
                    remains to this day one of the most recognizable visual metaphors in American
                    history.</p>
