        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

      <div type="editorial_desc">
        <p>This illustration in the <hi rendition="#italics">Pennsylvania Gazette</hi>, published by
          Benjamin Franklin, is widely regarded as the first American political cartoon. In this
          image, Franklin uses the image of a snake cut into eight pieces to make a political
          point—that American colonists from the 13 colonies, who often squabbled among one
          another—needed to unite to defend themselves against violence that threatened them all.
          The context for this cartoon was the outbreak of hostilities between France and Britain
          and their respective Native American allies in North America. This conflict is often
          called the French and Indian War in the United States, although the fighting in North
          America was only one theater of a worldwide conflict known as the Seven Years' War. In an
          editorial column, Franklin reported on Iroquois attacks against British colonists and
          warned that if the colonists did not agree to present a united front at the upcoming
          Albany Conference more violence would ensue. To illustrate his point, he added in an
          engraved image of a snake cut into pieces, each labeled with an abbreviation for a
          specific colony. Actually, this image cheats a little. Instead of showing a snake cut into
          13 pieces—one for each colony—the colonies that made up New England are combined into one
          segment—the snake's head—labeled "N. E." The other pieces of the snake are labeled "N.Y."
          (New York), "N. J." (New Jersey), P. (Pennsylvania), M. (Maryland), V. (Virginia), N. C.
          (North Carolina), and the tail is labeled "S. C." (South Carolina). The slogan
          accompanying the image, "Join, or Die," referenced the superstition that a snake that had
          been cut in half could come back to life if it could rejoin the pieces of its body before
          the sun set. This simple image contained several clear and powerful messages: although the
          colonists were divided, they had the chance to save themselves if they joined together.
          But time was short; if they failed to unite, the consequences could be fatal.</p>
        <p>This cartoon enjoyed instant popularity, and images of cut-up snakes were quickly
          republished in newspapers in New York and Boston. Much like modern-day internet memes,
          people who shared this image did not always copy it exactly as it had originally appeared,
          but often made changes to the image or the caption to appeal to their audience. For
          instance, when this cartoon ran in the <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Gazette</hi>, the
          caption was changed to "Unite and Conquer." Well after the Seven Years' War had ended,
          Franklin's snake became a symbol of colonial unity against controversial British policies
          when Paul Revere published his own version of "Join, or Die" during the Stamp Act crisis.
          It remained a popular pro-colonist symbol throughout the American Revolution and remains
          to this day one of the most recognizable visual metaphors in American history.</p>
