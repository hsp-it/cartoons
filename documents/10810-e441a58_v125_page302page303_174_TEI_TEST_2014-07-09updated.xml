        <p>The William Still Digital History Project weaves new connections between the manuscript
          journal and published book of William Still, known as the "Father of the Underground
          Railroad." Through text encoding, mapping, and other interpretive and contextual
          resources, this project will provide insight into the experiences of enslaved individuals
          and families who passed through Philadelphia between 1852 and 1857 and the covert networks
          that aided their escape.</p>

        <p><persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName>, AND HER FIVE CHILDREN, WITH FIVE OTHER
          PASSENGERS.</p>
        <p>One morning about the <date when="1855-11-01">first of November, in 1855</date>, the
          sleepy, slave-holding neighborhood of Chestertown, <sic>Maryland,was</sic> doubtless
          deeply excited on learning that eleven head of slaves, four head of horses, and two
          carriages were missing. It is but reasonable to suppose that the first report must have
          produced a shock, scarcely less stunning than an earthquake. Abolitionists, emissaries,
          and incendiaries were farther below par than ever. It may be supposed that cursings and
          threatenings were breathed out by a deeply agitated community for days in succession.</p>
        <p>Harriet Shephard, the mother of five children, for whom she felt of course a mother's
          love, could not bear the thought of having her offspring compelled to wear the miserable
          yoke of <sic>Slavery</sic>, as she had been compelled to do. By her own personal
          experience, Harriet could very well judge what their fate would be when reaching man and
          womanhood. She declared that she had never received "kind treatment." It was not on this
          account, however, that she was prompted to escape. She was actuated by a more
          disinterested motive than this. She was chiefly induced to make the bold effort to save
          her children from having to drag the chains of <sic>Slavery</sic> as she herself had
          done.</p>
        <p><persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName>, <persName key="ENT.000000011"
            >NAME</persName>, <persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName>, <persName
            key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName>, and <persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName>
          were the names of the children for whom she was willing to make any sacrifice. They were
          young, and unable to walk, and she was penniless, and unable to <pb n="303"
            facs="FIL.000091799"/> hire a conveyance, even if she had known <sic>any one</sic> who
          would have been willing to risk the law in taking them a night's journey. So there was no
          hope in these directions. Her rude intellect being considered, she was entitled to a great
          deal of credit for seizing the horses and carriages belonging to <rs key="ENT.000000011"
            >her master</rs>, as she did it for the liberation of her children.</p>
        <p>Knowing others at the same time, who were wanting to visit Canada, she consulted with
          five of this class, males and females, and they mutually decided to travel together.</p>
        <p>It is not likely that they knew much about the roads, nevertheless they reached
          Wilmington, Delaware, pretty direct, and ventured up into the heart of the town in
          carriages, looking as innocent as if they were going to meeting to hear an old-fashioned
          Southern sermon&#8212;"Servants, obey your masters." Of course, the distinguished
          travelers were immediately reported to the noted <persName key="ENT.000000011"
            >NAME</persName>, who was accustomed to transact the affairs of the Underground Rail
          Road in a cool masterly way. But, on this occasion, there was but little time for
          deliberation, but much need of haste to meet the emergency. He at once <sic>decided,
            that</sic> they must immediately be separated from the horses and carriages, and got out
          of Wilmington as quickly as possible. With the courage and skill, so characteristic of
          Garrett, the fugitives, under escort, were soon on their way to Kennett Square (a hot-bed
          of abolitionists and stock-holders of the Underground Rail Road), which place they reached
          safely. It so <sic>happened, that</sic> they reached <orgName key="ENT.000000187"
            >NAME</orgName> meeting-house in the evening, at which place a fair circle had convened.
          Being invited, they stayed awhile in the meeting, then, after remaining all night with one
          of the Kennett friends, they were brought to Downingtown early in the morning and thence,
          by daylight, within a short distance of Kimberton, and found succor with <persName
            key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName>, at the old headquarters of the fugitives.</p>
        <p>[A letter may be found from <persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName>, on <ref
            target="10810-e441a58_v125_page38page39_29_TEI.xml">page thirty-nine</ref>, throwing
          much light on this arrival]. After receiving friendly aid and advice while there, they
          were forwarded to the <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName> in Philadelphia. Here
          further aid was afforded them, and as danger was quite obvious, they were completely
          divided and disguised, so that the Committee felt that they might safely be sent on to
          Canada in one of the regular trains considered most private.</p>
        <p>Considering the condition of the <rs key="ENT.000000011">slave mother</rs> and her
          children and friends, all concerned rejoiced, that they had had the courage to use their
          master's horses and vehicles as they did.</p>
