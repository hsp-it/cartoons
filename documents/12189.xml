                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

                <p>American expansionism as well as the ideals of the Monroe Doctrine, which
                    rejected European rule and intervention in the Americas, led the United States
                    to intervene against Spain in the Cuban War for Independence (1895-1898). In
                    January 1898, the US sent the battleship USS <hi rendition="#italics">Maine</hi>
                    to Havana and on February 15, 1898, the battleship sunk after a mysterious
                    explosion. Although they lacked any credible evidence to support their claims,
                    newspapers held Spain responsible for the incident. In April 1898 the US
                    declared war. The Spanish-American War lasted for only ten weeks and ended with
                    the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898. As part of the
                    agreement, Spain granted Cuba its independence and ceded Guam and Puerto Rico to
                    the United States. The United States also purchased the Philippines from Spain
                    for $20 million and annexed Hawaii on August 12, 1898. The end of the war marked
                    a turning point in US foreign policy, as the Nation expanded its economic and
                    political influence in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                <p>The political cartoon comments on American expansionism in the Western
                    Hemisphere. In the image, Uncle Sam performs a circus act for European emperors,
                    monarchs, and leaders. He balances children, who are holding flags representing
                    Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Cuba, Philippines, and the Ladrones Islands, on his
                    shoulders and head. John Bull, the symbol for Great Britain, remarks in the
                    caption below the image: "It's really most extraordinary what training will do.
                    Why, only the other day I thought that man unable to support himself." The
                    children are drawn in a manner which reflects the ethnic and racial stereotypes of the era.</p>
                <p>Please note that the image of the political cartoon is taken from a scrapbook.
                    "How the Spaniard Became an Angel" which has been affixed below "Holding His End
                    Up" by the scrapbook creator has not been encoded because it was not originally
                    part of the <hi rendition="#italics">Philadelphia Inquirer</hi> cartoon "Holding
