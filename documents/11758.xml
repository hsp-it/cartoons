                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

                <p>In the political cartoon, a ship from Great Britain, carrying cholera and
                    immigrants headed to Castle Garden, is about to reach the New York shore. Men in
                    a boat labeled "board of health" meet the ship and try to disinfect it with
                    carbolic acid. Bottles of disinfectant labeled "disinfectant battery" are lined
                    up along the shore. The last great epidemic of cholera in 19th century Great
                    Britain is presumed to have spread from Egpyt, and thus, the figure of Death in
                    the political cartoon rides a ship flying a British Flag and wears a fez, Arab
                    style clothing, and a belt labeled "cholera." </p>
                <p>Cholera is a disease which effects the intestines, and it is spread through
                    drinking water which has been contaminated with the vibrio cholerea bacteria. An
                    infected patient experiences violent cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea and becomes
                    so dehydrated that the blood thickens. If left untreated, a patient will die
                    within a few days. 19th century physicians treated patients with opium or by
                    bleeding them. Carbolic acid was widely used as a disinfectant.</p>

                        defend against the British during the War of 1812. In 1823, it was renamed
