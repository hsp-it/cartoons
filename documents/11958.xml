        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>Depicted as a parrot, Samuel Pennypacker is perched on a large boot. Representative
          Frederick Taylor Pusey, who tried to pass an anti-cartoon law in Pennsylvania, is depicted
          as a large cat. He is wearing a large bow and name tag. A scroll with the words
          "anti-cartoon bill" written on it lays next to the boot. Below the image there is a brief
          satirical article about the cartoon censorship.</p>
        <p>During the gubernatorial election of 1902, Charles Nelan drew a series of unflattering
          cartoons about candidate Samuel Pennypacker, illustrating him as party boss Matthew Quay's
          trained parrot. When Pennypacker won the election, he and Pusey tried to pass an
          anti-cartoon law which would prohibit cartoonists from depicting politicians in any
          non-human form. Pusey's bill did not pass, but in May 1903 Pennypacker signed a similar
          bill into legislation. Cartoonists across the nation criticized the law. Because of public
          outrage, the law was never enforced and was later repealed in 1907.</p>
