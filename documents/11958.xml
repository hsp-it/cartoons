                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the

                <p>Depicted as a parrot, Samuel Pennypacker is perched on a large boot.  Representative Frederick Taylor Pusey, who tried to pass an anti-cartoon law in Pennsylvania, is depicted as a large cat.  He is wearing a large bow and name tag.  A scroll with the words "anti-cartoon bill" written on it lays next to the boot.  Below the image there is a brief satirical article about the cartoon censorship.</p>
                <p>During the gubernatorial election of 1902, Charles Nelan drew a series of unflattering cartoons about candidate Samuel Pennypacker, illustrating him as party boss Matthew Quay's trained parrot.  When Pennypacker won the election, he and Pusey tried to pass an anti-cartoon law which would prohibit cartoonists from depicting politicians in any non-human form.  Pusey's bill did not pass, but in May 1903 Pennypacker signed a similar bill into legislation.  Cartoonists across the nation criticized the law.  Because of public outrage, the law was never enforced and was later repealed in 1907.</p>
