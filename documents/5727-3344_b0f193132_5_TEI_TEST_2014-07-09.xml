        <p>The Greenfield Digital Project interprets the story of Bankers Trust Company, a large
          Philadelphia bank that failed in 1930, through a selection of primary source documents,
          contextual essays, and teacher resources. The project is part of a larger effort funded by
          the Albert M. Greenfield Foundation to make HSP's 20th-century holdings more

            <head>WILLIAM D. GORDON</head>
            <p>Secretary of the <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName>, who has ordered
              liquidation of the Bankers Trust Company.</p>

        <p>The <hi rendition="#handwritten-underlined">Bankers Trust Company</hi> will be liquidated
          as soon as the necessary legal steps can be completed by Dr. William Gordon, Secretary of
          the State Department of Banking, announced in Harrisburg last night.</p>
        <p>He made no estimate of what percentage of their deposits the depositors might expect to
          receive but stated that 25 <sic>per cent.</sic> of all deposits would be paid by straight
          liquidation as soon as several <unclear reason="torn">legal</unclear> hurdles can be
          cleared which <unclear reason="torn"/> probably will not be before <unclear reason="torn"
            >early <date when="1931-12">December</date>.</unclear></p>
        <p>In the face of his decision, supported by a lengthy statement in review of the situation,
          both <persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName>, president of the defunct institution
          at Juniper and Walnut streets, and <persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName>, counsel
          for the Depositors' Committee, announced that the plan for reorganization will not be
          abandoned.</p>
        <p rendition="#bold">Backed by <persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName></p>
        <p>They were supported in this decision by Sidney J. Burgoyne, chairman of the committee
          which has been at work for nine months attempting to prepare a plan which <fw
            rendition="#bold">Continued on 12th Page, <sic>2d</sic> column</fw> would meet the
          approval of the Banking Department.</p>
        <p>"We do not take the position of <sic>believeing</sic> that Dr. Gordon's decision is
          final," Mr. Shapiro said last night. "I am firmly of the opinion that we can still prove
          to Dr. Gordon that reorganization of Bankers Trust Company, in conformity with our plan,
          is not only a constructive move, but an imperative one.</p>
        <p>"We believe that the straight liquidation of the bank not only will delay relief to the
          depositors, who have suffered desperately already, but that it will measurably decrease
          the amount of money which they might receive under a reorganization. I think that we can
          persuade Dr. Gordon that the disposition of approximately $31,000,000 worth of <pb n="2"
            facs="FIL.000041451"/> the present market is not a <unclear reason="torn">wise
            move</unclear>, and is not one likely <unclear reason="torn">to</unclear> improve either
          the business nor the banking situation in this city."</p>
        <p rendition="#bold">Committee Summoned</p>
        <p>He revealed that a meeting of the entire <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName> will
          be held this morning in his office, where the situation will be discussed and some plan
          for further pressing the attempt to reorganize the <rs key="ENT.000000187">NAME</rs> will
          be taken. </p>
        <p>"I must say that I am surprised," <persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName> declared
          last night, when asked to comment on <persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName>'s
          decision. "None the less, I am still persuaded that <orgName key="ENT.000000187"
            >NAME</orgName> can be reopened under the reorganization plan now overwhelmingly
          assented to by both stockholders and depositors. That plan will not be abandoned." </p>
        <p>The <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName>'s decision to order liquidation of the
          assets of the trust company, instead of approving the plan for reorganization, as had been
          confidently hoped by the depositors and directors, was based upon the failure of the
          depositors' committee to comply with two of the four conditions upon which Dr. Gordon
          founded his approval of the attempt to devise a reorganization plan.</p>
        <p rendition="#bold">Unable To Raise Fund</p>
        <p>These were failures to raise the sum of $3,500,000 in cash, and the failure to obtain
          officers and directors who would be of such standing in the community as not only to meet
          the approval of the department, but as would also command the respect and confidence of
          the community generally.</p>
        <p>Both <persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName> and <persName key="ENT.000000011"
            >NAME</persName> confessed to such failure last night, but said that there were factors
          in the situation which in their <unclear reason="torn">opinion</unclear> tended to
          mitigate the importance of the conditions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gordon took up the matter in a 1200-word typewritten statement, issued at Harrisburg,
          in which he traced every step taken since the Bankers Trust Company, at Juniper and Walnut
          streets, closed its doors last <date when="1930-12-22">December 22</date>.</p>
        <p>The reason for the voluntary closing of the doors by the directors, as announced at that
          time, was "the steady seepage of deposits over a period of several months," actually
          dating from the preceding <date when="1930-07">July</date>.</p>
        <p>The most recent called statement of the institution prior to its closing, that of <date
            when="1930-09">September, 1930</date>, listed the deposits at approximately $42,500,000.
          The institution had approximately 105,000 depositors and operated nineteen branches.</p>
        <p>In <ref target="5719-3344_b0f1930_4_TEI.xml">an address which he made on <date
              when="1930-12-26">December 26</date> last</ref>, Mr. Barker told the men and women who
          gathered in the <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName> to form a depositors'
          committee, that the Bankers Trust had time and demands deposits totaling $34,500,000 and
          that the institution's condition warranted the statement that depositors would be paid 100
          cents <unclear reason="torn">on</unclear> the dollar, with a surplus of about $5,000,000
          for stockholders.</p>
        <p>A number of guesses at the condition of the bank have been made since that time, all of
          them apocryphal, and conjectures as to the amount that the depositors will receive have
          ranged anywhere from 40 to 70 cents on the dollar.</p>
        <p rendition="#bold">Seek Former Firm's Funds</p>
        <p>The first step toward liquidation will be instituting of legal proceedings to take
          possession of the assets of the <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName>, which was
          merged with Bankers Trust Company on <date when="1930-07-21">July 21, 1930</date>.</p>
        <p>This was the largest of the eight consolidations that had been effected since <date
            when="1926-12">December, 1926</date>, and, according to Dr. Gordon, the assets of the
          last and largest of the consolidated institutions were being liquidated by "a joint
          committee of that institution and by my deputy under a former agreement between that
          institution and Bankers Trust Company."</p>
        <p>Following that, an appraisal will be made of the assets of Bankers Trust, and thirty days
          time shall be given for the filing of claims by all depositors and creditors.</p>
        <p>"As soon as the necessary legal requirements are fulfilled," the statement says, "the
          department will make a preliminary distribution of 25 <sic>per cent.</sic> to
          depositors."</p>
        <p rendition="#bold">Text of Statement</p>
        <p>Dr. Gordon's statement follows:</p>
        <p>"The Bankers Trust Company, of Philadelphia, was closed by resolution of its board of
          directors and possession surrendered to the Secretary of Banking <date when="1930-12-22"
            >December 22, 1930</date>. Before and since my appointment as Secretary of Banking the
          Department of Banking has labored industriously to collect as rapidly as possible the
          outstanding loans and obligations and convert them into cash <pb n="3"

            TRUST</fw> toward meeting the deposit liability of approximately $28,000,000. Since the
          department took possession, it has succeeded in paying off $9,000,000 of obligations owed
          by Bankers Trust Company to other banking institutions, thereby regaining possession of
          collateral which had been pledged for such loans. In addition, we have made collection of
          cash which brings the cash balance to over $7,000,000.</p>
        <p>"Since <date when="1931-04">April</date> a committee of depositors of the closed
          institution has been engaged in a plan for a proposed reorganization of the bank and
          opening of the central office by a new institution to be organized by the former
          depositors and stockholders. This committee has worked untiringly to accomplish this
          result.</p>
        <p>"Through the co-operation of the Department of Banking, there was <pb n="4"
            facs="FIL.000041451"/> passed by the Legislature and approved by <persName
            key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName> on <date when="1931-05-28">May 28, 1931</date>, an
          Act of Assembly enlarging the powers of the <rs key="ENT.000000187">NAME</rs> and
          conferring certain powers to aid in the effecting of reorganizations of banks, should
          feasible plans be at hand.</p>
        <p rendition="#bold">Four Demands Listed</p>
        <p>"Four prerequisites, as absolutely essential to the successful accomplishment of the
          proposed plan of reorganization, were stipulated by me:</p>
        <p>"1. The raising of $3,500,000 in cash from the depositors of the existing institution
          secured by collateral now held in my possession which is to be sold to the new company if
          the same is organized, the selection of this collateral for sale to the new company
          together with cash assets in my possession to be determined exclusively by me.</p>
        <p>"2. Personnel consisting of officers and directors of the new institution entirely
          acceptable to me and to be of such character as will unquestionably command the support
          and confidence of the depositors and the public of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>"3. Evidence of payment of cash by the subscribing stockholders to the new company of
          $800,000 for their stock subscriptions.</p>
        <p>"4. Reasonable assurance to me that the new institution, if chartered, will be able to
          continue functioning, and will not exist merely for the purpose of gradual liquidation by
          the payment of depositors' claims.</p>
        <p rendition="#bold">Urged Final Decision</p>
        <p>"From the beginning I specified these conditions, and have rigidly adhered to them up
          until the present time.</p>
        <p>"I have given every aid and <unclear reason="torn">sympathetic </unclear> consideration
          to the requests <gap reason="torn"/> time made by the depositors' committee, although I
          have repeatedly urged a final decision in view of the necessity of the situation and of
          the many inquiries being made of me and of my department by innumerable depositors whose
          funds have been tied up in the closed institution.</p>
        <p>"At first, it was believed that a decision on this matter of reorganization could be
          attained during the latter part of June. However, at that time no substantial progress had
          been made with respect to the obtaining of cash and of personnel. At the request of the
          committee, I then granted an extension until July 15 to bring the problem to a conclusion.
          While splendid efforts were made by the members of the depositors' committee they were
          still unable to furnish me with a satisfactory personnel of officers and directors and
          with evidence of the necessary cash on hand.</p>
        <p rendition="bold">Extensions Granted</p>
        <p>"To enable members of the committee to pursue certain lines of endeavor, at their
          request, an <unclear reason="torn">extension</unclear> was given for final decision
            <unclear reason="torn">until</unclear>
          <date when="1931-08-15">August 15</date>. It was impressed on <unclear reason="torn"
            >the</unclear> committee that in justice to the <unclear reason="torn">mass</unclear> of
          depositors their efforts must be expedited. Subsequently, a joint meeting of the
          stockholders and depositors' committee was held in my office to permit a presentation of
          the status of the work of the latter committee. The depositors' committee submitted a new
          plan and confidently stated that with a further extension of thirty days it could obtain
          the necessary amount of cash to insure the opening of the new institution from a financial
          standpoint, and would present a personnel of officers and directors which would meet the
          requirements mentioned by me as well as meet the other stipulations.</p>
        <p>"A further effort to co-operate with the committee was made by me when I granted an
          extension until <date when="1931-09-21">September 21</date>, for a presentation of
          evidence showing a final culmination of the plan in accordance with the four prerequisites
          heretofore mentioned.</p>
        <p>"On Friday, <date when="1931-09-18">September 18</date>, the committee met with me to
          present its report. It reported that it had been unable to obtain the loan of $3,500,000,
          which was one of the basic essentials to the plan. It also informed me that every effort
          had been made to enlist the aid of outstanding types of business men and bankers to serve
          as officers and directors of the proposed institution, but that their efforts to date had
          been in vain.</p>
        <p>"The committee requested a further extension of time to follow entirely new lines of
          endeavor to raise the necessary cash, to obtain a satisfactory personnel, and to meet the
          other requirements for the plan.</p>
        <p rendition="#bold">Refuses Extension</p>
        <p>"I informed the committee at this meeting that under no circumstances would I grant a
          further extension without discussing the matter fully with Governor Pinchot on <date
            when="1931-09-28">Monday</date>.</p>
        <p>"Because of the legal phases involved, I had <persName key="ENT.000000011"
            >NAME</persName>, Deputy Attorney General, present at the conference with the
          Governor.</p>
        <p>"After deliberate consideration, Governor Pinchot and I agreed to grant a final extension
          of thirty days, namely, until Wednesday, <date when="1931-10-21">October 21</date>, to the
          depositors' committee to enable it to determine whether it could successfully obtain the
          required cash from the source outlined and to fulfill the other stipulations set forth by
          me as essential for the reorganization of the trust company. Furthermore, it was
          stipulated that this extension was being made with the express understanding that no other
          request would be made directly or indirectly of the Governor or of me for a further
          extension beyond <date when="1931-10-21">October 21, 1931</date>.</p>
        <p>"After reviewing the agreement of extension subject to the conditions enumerated, the
          committee returned the original agreement of extension unsigned and submitted therefore an
          alternative agreement with material changes drawn up by the committee. In view of the
          decision not to agree to the thirty days as a final extension as prescribed by me and in
          view of the fact that to date, aside from the fact that the $3,500,000 in cash has not
          been secured, the committee has not succeeded in obtaining a leadership for the new bank
          of such executives and directors as would inspire the necessary confidence required to
          hold a substantial part of the depositors with which the new bank would open and beyond
          that would attract business to the bank, which would justify its existence.</p>
        <p rendition="#bold">Aid Quest Fails</p>
        <p>"In the last few weeks I have been cognizant that the situation was approaching the point
          where a decision had to be conclusively made. In the event that this decision would be for
          liquidation I, on my own initiative, made overtures to certain banking institutions to
          come to the relief of <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName> by making available
          promptly such a percentage of their <pb n="5" facs="FIL.000078073"/>
          <fw><orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName>, <date when="1931-09-24">THURSDAY MORNING,
              SEPTEMBER</date>
            <gap reason="torn"/></fw> deposits as to be agreed upon a safely and quickly realizable
          in <unclear reason="torn">case</unclear> from the assets. Such a plan <unclear
            reason="torn">could</unclear> have been consummated with <unclear reason="torn"
            >the</unclear> Act of Assembly of <date when="1931-05-28">May 28, 1931</date>. However,
          such efforts have proved unrealizable in view of the desire of these other institutions to
          avoid the misunderstanding that might <unclear reason="torn">be</unclear> caused by the
          appearance at their doors of large numbers of people making demands for funds under
          misapprehensions as to the scope of relief being suggested.</p>
        <p>"In view of the foregoing, I have no alternative except to proceed with an orderly
          liquidation of the assets of <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName> in accordance
          with the procedure fixed and the powers conferred upon me by the banking code of
          Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p rendition="#bold">Lauds Committee</p>
        <p>"The <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName> worked faithfully and diligently in its
          endeavor to effect a plan of reorganization. For several months it has given of its means,
          time and ability <unclear reason="torn">to</unclear> this end. Unfortunately, through
            <unclear reason="torn">a</unclear> combination of circumstances be- <pb n="6"
            facs="FIL.000041451"/> yond its control, it has not been able to accomplish its
          objectives. Nevertheless it is deserving of credit for its services.</p>
        <p>"My first step will be to file the necessary proceedings to take possession of the assets
          of the <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName>, which were being liquidated by a joint
          committee of that institution and by my deputy under a former agreement between that
          institution and <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName>. These assets now, therefore,
          will be under my sole control and direction.</p>
        <p>"In accordance with the law, I shall then proceed to have an appraisal prepared of all
          the assets of Bankers Trust Company and of Bank of Philadelphia and Trust Company by
          disinterested appraisers, and I shall give thirty days' time in accordance with the recent
          enabling act for the filing of claims by all depositors and creditors.</p>
        <p>"Soon as the necessary legal requirements are fulfilled the department will make a
          preliminary distribution of 25 <sic>per cent.</sic> to depositors. Every effort will then
          be made by me to realize as quickly as is practicable on the other assets of the bank, so
          that the money can be paid out to depositors as quickly as it is humanly possible to do
          so.</p>
        <p>"The interest of the depositors is foremost in the minds of <persName key="ENT.000000011"
            >NAME</persName> and of me, and the assets of the institution will be liquidated solely
          by the <orgName key="ENT.000000187">NAME</orgName>, thus insuring liquidation by an
          impartial agency which is interested only in obtaining the highest percentage on the
          dollar for the depositors."</p>
