                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

                <p>The branches of a large tree form an image of railroad financier Jay Gould. Gould owned the Western Union Telegraph Company, the <hi rendition="#italics">New York World</hi> newspaper, and several railroads including the Union Pacific Railroad.  On September 24, 1869 his financial schemes led to crash of the American gold market, otherwise known as "Black Friday."</p>
                <p>Below the tree lie the bodies of politicians and former business partners whose careers and bank accounts were destroyed due to their dealings with Gould.  President Ulysses S. Grant's political reputation was damaged due to his association with Gould and the "Black Friday" scandal.  He rests at the base of the tree trunk, and, in his left hand, holds a label with the inscription "Black Friday."  Next to Grant, there is a body of an unknown stockholder labeled "Stockholder E.R.R" and of an unknown woman labeled "Stockholder."  Alonzo Cornell holds the label "Blind pool Cornell" in his right hand.</p>
                <p>The skull and bones of Jim Fisk are next to the body of Whitelaw Reid.  Fisk was murdered in 1872 by his ex-lover's boyfriend Edward Stokes.  Stokes tried to blackmail Fisk out of a huge sum of and money, and when he wouldn't give into his demands, Stokes stabbed him.  Next to Fisk, lies Theodoric Westbrook.  He wears a hat with his name written across it and is slumped over a row of a buildings.  Roscoe Conkling lies next to the same row of buildings.  From the branches of the old tree hang coins and dollar signs, as well as, bribes for lawyers, legislatures, congress, editors, and judges.</p>
