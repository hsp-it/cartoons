        <p>The Greenfield Digital Project interprets the story of Bankers Trust Company, a large
          Philadelphia bank that failed in 1930, through a selection of primary source documents,
          contextual essays, and teacher resources. The project is part of a larger effort funded by
          the Albert M. Greenfield Foundation to make HSP's 20th-century holdings more
          accessible.</p>

        <p>On the <sic>occasion of retirement</sic> of Jacob Netter as chairman of the board of
          directors of Bankers Trust Company of Philadelphia, and as a testimonial of their personal
          regard and esteem for him, directors of the institution presented him with a loving cup
          yesterday. It was Mr. Netter's desire that he should not be re-elected.</p>

        <p>All other officers of Bankers Trust Co. were re-elected when the new board of directors
          organized following the stockholders meeting. Samuel H. Barker is president of the
          company. Vice presidents are <persName ref="Greenfield_project_people.xml#Lutz_J_Milton"

            >Samuel Graham, Jr.</persName></p>

        <p><sic>Annual report of the president</sic> of Bankers Trust Co. to the stockholders shows
          that during last year the deposits increased 55% to $25,553,761, and the resources 70% to
          $38,988,699. Capital, surplus and undivided profits were increased during the year 90% to
          $7,563,148, this after payment of 6% dividend on the stock, which now stands $4,876,800.
          The report states that besides paying the dividend "various operations (some of them
          abnormal) permitted the transfer of $1,000,000 to surplus, raising that fund to $1,500,000
          and the addition of $774,691 to undivided profits, which were thus increased to
          $1,186,348." It was also announced that Bankers Trust Company is doing business with more
          than 67,000 depositors and others in eleven offices, and that 83.5% in number of its
          officers and <sic>employes</sic> are stockholders, among them holding 5.23% of the
          outstanding stock.</p>
