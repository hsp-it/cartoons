                            Institute for Ethnic Studies. Some of the 20th century cartoons and
                            drawings were removed from the J. Hampton Moore papers (Collection
                            1541). </acquisition>

                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

He lost the nomination to Alton B. Parker in July 1904.  In the cartoon, William Randolph Hearst, dressed in formal attire, gives a toast to a cast of comic cartoon characters who are seated at a large table.  Most of the comic characters appeared in Hearst's newspapers.</p>
                <p>Next to Hearst there is a waiter carrying a tray with drinks and a dinosaur who is eating a portrait of Theodore Roosevelt.  The comic cartoon character, Foxy Grandpa, is seated to Hearst's left.  On the window sill, characters from the <hi rendition="#italics">Little Tigers</hi> comic strip play musical instruments.  Hanz from the comic strip <hi rendition="#italics">Katzenjammer Kids</hi>, balances a champagne bottle on his nose.  His brother Fritz sprays champagne into der Captain's face. Mamma, the woman seated across from Fritz, looks stern and points her finger in disapproval. Alphose and Gaston, in the lower right corner of the image, bow to each other.</p>

It debuted in the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Journal</hi> in 1901 and featured two Frenchmen who are so polite that they never managed to get anywhere or accomplish anything.  They each bow to each other and insist that the other go first:  "After you, Alphonse"; "No, you first, my dear Gaston."  In the political cartoon, Gaston, the tall and slender man and his short friend Alphonse bow to each other.  Most likely they each insist that the other take a seat.</p>
