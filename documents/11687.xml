            <acquisition>This is an artificial collection created over time by HSP staff mostly
              through donations and purchases of individual prints. It also incorporates previously
              uncataloged materials collected by the Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies. Some of the
              20th century cartoons and drawings were removed from the J. Hampton Moore papers

        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>William Randolph Hearst owned the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Journal</hi> and the
            <hi rendition="#italics">San Francisco Examiner</hi> and in 1904 campaigned to become
          the democratic nominee. He lost the nomination to Alton B. Parker in July 1904. In the
          cartoon, William Randolph Hearst, dressed in formal attire, gives a toast to a cast of
          comic cartoon characters who are seated at a large table. Most of the comic characters
          appeared in Hearst's newspapers.</p>
        <p>Next to Hearst there is a waiter carrying a tray with drinks and a dinosaur who is eating
          a portrait of Theodore Roosevelt. The comic cartoon character, Foxy Grandpa, is seated to
          Hearst's left. On the window sill, characters from the <hi rendition="#italics">Little
            Tigers</hi> comic strip play musical instruments. Hanz from the comic strip <hi
            rendition="#italics">Katzenjammer Kids</hi>, balances a champagne bottle on his nose.
          His brother Fritz sprays champagne into der Captain's face. Mamma, the woman seated across
          from Fritz, looks stern and points her finger in disapproval. Alphonse and Gaston, in the
          lower right corner of the image, bow to each other.</p>
