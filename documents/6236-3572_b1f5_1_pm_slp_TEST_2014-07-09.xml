        <p>The Bank of America Digital Project, "Preserving American Freedom," explores how
          Americans have interpreted and fought for their freedoms from the 1600s to the present day
          and how these freedoms have shaped America's history. To this end, the project presents a
          selection of primary source documents from HSP's collection that illuminate conceptions,
          facets, and conflicts of freedom, as well as interpretive and contextual essays and
          resources for educators.</p>

          transcribed just the text related to the article, ignoring other text or markings on the
          page that were purposefully or inadvertently included during clipping. We have regularized
          spacing between words and sentences to replace double (or triple) spaces to a single

          <p>We are engaged in a total war. A total war must be fought by all people. And it is the
            people's war on the home front as well as on the battle front.<note n="1"
              type="editorial">World War II was commonly called a "people's war," referencing not
              only its inclusion of the entire state as a fighting force (overseas military was
              matched by war production on the home front), but also the wide range of support the
              war received.</note> On the home front we cannot contribute our full strength to the
            war effort if we allow preconceived prejudices and artificial hiring standards to
            sabotage production. How can we expect to win a people's war if we maintain barriers
            against any group? For is not this great country dedicated to the proposition that all
            men are created equal? One man or woman, or one group of men or women, cannot win this
            people's war. The people must win it, all together. An important meeting is taking place
            in the offices of one of our largest organizations engaged in the manufacture of the
            machinery of war.</p>

          <p>The War Department is not satisfied with your production.</p>

          <p><persName>Mr. Johns</persName>, I assure you we're doing our level best.</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>JOHNS</persName></speaker>
          <p>Well, frankly, <persName>Mr. Peters</persName>, it isn't good enough. We had expected
            your tremendous industrial organization to make a great contribution to our war effort.
            The results so far have been definitely unsatisfactory. May I ask why?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>PETERS</persName></speaker>
          <p>The answer is simple: labor. We can't get the skilled machinists we need at Plant 32.
            And although Plant 32 is small in comparison to the rest of our factories, it is the
            keystone.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>JOHNS</persName></speaker>
          <p>Hmm. Or the bottleneck. How can this bottleneck be eliminated?</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>PETERS</persName></speaker>
          <p>I don't know. We've tried our best.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>JOHNS</persName></speaker>
          <p>You wouldn't want us to pirate our labor, take men away from other factories?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>PETERS</persName></speaker>
          <p>Oh no, of course not. We'd only be hurting ourselves to pull a stunt like that.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>JOHNS</persName></speaker>
          <p>We were almost desperate enough to try even that, but Mr. Kinley, our president,
            counseled against it.</p>

          <p>Well, three weeks ago, I was almost ready to do that. But the main reason for this
            so-called disguise was to find out for myself just exactly what was wrong with 32. And
            gentlemen, I think I've gotten to the root of our trouble. I went to 32 and applied for
            a job. After standing in line for nearly three hours, I finally got in to see the
            personnel manager, <persName>George Rimmer</persName>. He didn't recognize me...</p>

          <p>Well, now to get at it. You say that you're a skilled machinist, but you haven't worked
            at your trade for the last twenty-five years. Why?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>I've been in business for myself. When the war came along, I thought I'd do the thing
            I'm best fitted for to help the war effort.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>RIMMER</persName></speaker>
          <p>The high wages wouldn't have anything to do with it, would they?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>There is such a thing as patriotism, sir.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>RIMMER</persName></speaker>
          <p>Hm? Ah, yes—yes, of course. Well, your application seems to be in order. When can you
            come to work?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>Tomorrow morning, sir.</p>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>RIMMER</persName></speaker>
          <p>Good. Oh, by the way, you say your name is <persName>Kinley</persName>...</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>I don't only say it—it is <persName>Kinley</persName>.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>RIMMER</persName></speaker>
          <p>I've no doubt that it is, but is it your adopted name, or were you born with it?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>RIMMER</persName></speaker>
          <p>Well, many men on arriving in this country from Europe or other places change their
            name under the—the impression that things will be easier for them with a more Anglicized
            name.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>I don't really understand what you're trying to find out. Suppose I were
            foreign-born.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>RIMMER</persName></speaker>
          <p>Well, during war times, er, we must check on the background of our employees—it's very
            important.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>I see. Well, it happens that the name has been in my family for quite a long time. And
            I'm an American citizen.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>RIMMER</persName></speaker>
          <p>Thank you. That's all. You will receive word at your lodging house when to report for
            work. Oh, just a moment, <persName>Kinley</persName>. Er, do you have any objections to
            working on Sundays?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>No, not if it's necessary.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>RIMMER</persName></speaker>
          <p>Well, some of our men prefer to take Sunday off because of their church.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>Well, I consider myself a religious man, but if I can do something extra for my country
            by working Sundays...well, no objection.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>RIMMER</persName></speaker>
          <p>Fine, fine. Er, then you may have Saturday or any other day that will make your Sabbath
            churchgoing convenient. Saturday all right?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>My church doesn't hold services on Saturday.</p>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>RIMMER</persName></speaker>
          <p>Er, well, well, something probably can be arranged with some of the other men. Good
            day, Mr. Kinley—you'll hear from us not later than tomorrow. </p>

          <p>Ain't much to tell. I been to school to learn machine tunin'. I got good marks. I
            graduated, but that man <persName>Rimmer</persName> won't hire me 'cause...'cause I
            ain't the same color he is.</p>

        <sp>

          <p>I never even got that far. He took one look at my name on the application and told me
            it wasn't the policy of the plant to hire Jews. Didn't find out if I was a good hand at

          <speaker><persName>JANOWSKY</persName></speaker>
          <p>Why? Because he no like my people, too. In first place, he thinks I am foreign. In

          <p>Mr. Rimmer, I know that you're shorthanded for men, so I brought back <persName>Gregor
              Janowsky</persName>. I used to work with <persName>Mr. Janowsky</persName>. In fact,
            he taught me most of what I know about machine tools. He needs a job. Now, you've got a

        <sp>

          <p><persName>Mr. Kinley</persName>, you will please confine your activities to the factory

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>Just exactly what are the qualifications for employment here, <persName>Mr.
              Rimmer</persName>? I've discovered that you won't hire a Negro because of his color,
            or a Jew or a Catholic because of their religion. The men you've turned down are all
            good Americans, all expert workmen. Does a man have to be your color, go to your church,
            belong to your political party to work here? On whose authority do you make these
            restrictions?</p>

          <p>That's all I wanted to know, <persName>Mr. Rimmer</persName>. It so happens there is

        <sp>
          <speaker><persName>KINLEY</persName></speaker>
          <p>I'm afraid that an American plant manufacturing the weapons for the people's war
            against Nazism and all the things it stands for is hardly the right place for you. I'll
            give you one hour to leave the plant. I happen to be your boss: <persName>W. A.

          <p>And that, gentlemen, was our bottleneck: not the fact that we couldn't find good
            workmen, but that we had as our personnel manager <persName>Rimmer</persName>—a man who
            should have been working for <persName key="ENT.000000011">NAME</persName> and company.
            I think that we shall no longer have trouble at Number 32, and I intend to go through
            the entire organization and root out every single instance of racial and religious
            prejudice. And I'm willing to wager that we shall have increased production as a direct
            result. The only way for Americans to fight a war is with American weapons, and we can't
            make American weapons with un-American intolerance. And now, gentlemen, I should like to
            introduce my new personnel manager, in complete charge of the personnel at all our
            plants.</p>

          <p>Management must take the initiative, must open its doors to all loyal and capable
            workers. Individually, we may have our differences, but this one thing we have in
            common: our great love for our principles set down in our Constitution and written into
            our laws, that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator
            with certain unalienable rights. Among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
            happiness. And may we add another: the right to work. Lest We Forget: Eternal Vigilance
            in Business is the Price of Liberty.</p>
