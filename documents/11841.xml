        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>This cartoon depicts the violence perpetrated against African Americans during the New
          York City Draft Riots of July 13-16, 1863. It shows Abraham Lincoln, at far left, standing
          with his back turned to the riot taking place behind him. Lincoln, shown wearing striped
          pants and a jacket, is scowling and looking off into the distance; he has his arms crossed
          across his chest with one hand raised to his chin, as if stroking his beard. Behind him,
          at the center of the cartoon, an Irish-American man wearing striped pants and a shirt
          decorated with stars (evoking the flag of the United States), stands over the body of an
          African American man lying on the ground. The Irish-American man raises his right fist to
          strike at another African American man, who he restrains with his left hand. The African
          American man threatened by the rioter stretches his arm out in an appeal to the
          unresponsive Lincoln. At right, another white rioter, whose face we cannot see, grabs the
          African American man's shirt, pulling him toward the background of the cartoon, in which a
          gallows can be seen. Behind them can be seen numerous other rioters. Below the
          illustration is a caption in which eyewitness accounts from the scenes of the riots,
          reported in local newspapers, are partially reprinted.</p>
