                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

            <div type="editorial_desc">
                <p>This cartoon depicts Matthew Quay, a powerful Pennsylvania political boss and United States Senator and all of the acusations against him. Extremely rich in imagery, this cartoon addresses the controversies surrounding Quay and his silence in the face of his critics. Known in some circles as "the Silent Leader," Quay made a habit of saying as few words as possible, particularly when addressing the press. Often, his silence was interpreted as acknowledgement of guilt. Matthew Quay was a political boss who can be compared to the most famous of all political bosses, William "Boss" Tweed. Nineteenth century political bosses often had inordinate amounts of power through money and business connections, were capable of controlling voting patters and elections, and were generally associated with organized crime and corruption.</p>

                <p>Thomas Nast often skewered "Boss" Tweed in his political cartoons and has used that model to depict Matthew Quay in this rendering. The lizard may be a depiction of Tweed looking down over the efforts of his fellow political boss, Quay.</p>

                <p>Lady Justice is often depicted, as she is here, wearing a blindfold representing the idea that justice should be served objectively and impartially. She is also commonly depicted holding scales to show that she is weighing both sides of a particular matter. In this cartoon, she is also gagged and shackled, the allegation being that Matthew Quay used his power to inappropriately interfere with the process of justice and law.</p>

                <p>The eagle's head, labeled with the word, "LIBERTY," along with the horses, are a parody of the Pennsyvania coat of arms.  The official coat of arms features two rearing horses on either side of central depictions of Pennsylvania's resources. Above the horses is an eagle and below is the state motto, "Virtue, Liberty, and Independence." In this cartoon, the eagle appears to be squashed under the Quay quote either unconscious or dead, the horses seem to be running away,  and a portrait of Delamater replaces the central depiction of Pennsylvania's offerings.</p>
