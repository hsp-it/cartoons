                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

                <p>This cartoon depicts Matthew Quay, a powerful Pennsylvania political boss and
                    United States Senator and many of the accusations leveled against him. Extremely
                    rich in imagery, this cartoon addresses the controversies surrounding Quay and
                    his silence in the face of his critics. Known in some circles as "the Silent
                    Leader," Quay made a habit of saying as few words as possible, particularly when
                    addressing the press. Often, his silence was interpreted as acknowledgement of
                    guilt. Matthew Quay was a political boss who can be compared to the most famous
                    of all political bosses, William "Boss" Tweed. Nineteenth-century political
                    bosses often had inordinate amounts of power through money and business
                    connections, were capable of controlling voting patters and elections, and were
                    generally associated with organized crime and corruption.</p>
                <p>This is not a published cartoon but rather Thomas Nast's original artwork. Nast
                    seems to have started by pasting a photograph of Matthew Quay on a board, then
                    collaging over a layer of pen and ink drawings on a prepared Ben-Day shaded
                    background. This layer has a tombstone-shaped hole cut out to frame Quay's
                    portrait. A few pieces of paper containing label text ("A Branded Criminal,"
                    "Judas Iscariot," and Quay's quote, "I have been making governors all my life,
                    but I have never had one of my own. I am going to nominate Delamater and know
                    how it feels to own a governor just for once") were cut and pasted on later. The
                    composition was subsequently published as the cover image of the October 25,
                    1890, issue of <hi rendition="#italics"><orgName key="ENT.000003639">Illustrated

                <p>Justice is often depicted, as she is here, wearing a blindfold representing the
                    idea that justice should be served objectively and impartially. She is also
                    commonly depicted holding scales to show that she is weighing both sides of a
                    particular matter. In this cartoon, she is also gagged and shackled, the
                    allegation being that <persName key="ENT.000001953">Matthew Quay</persName> used
                    his power to inappropriately interfere with the process of justice and law.</p>

                    Above the horses is an eagle and below is the state motto, "Virtue, Liberty, and
