                <p>The William Still Digital History Project weaves new connections between the
                    manuscript journal and published book of William Still, known as the "Father of
                    the Underground Railroad." Through text encoding, mapping, and other
                    interpretive and contextual resources, this project will provide insight into
                    the experiences of enslaved individuals and families who passed through
                    Philadelphia between 1852 and 1857 and the covert networks that aided their
                    escape.</p>

                <p>We have generally encoded entire documents/texts, not excerpts. We have encoded
                    page breaks. We have also preserved original spelling, typographical errors,
                    missing text, and original capitalization. We have regularized spacing between
                    words and sentences to replace double (or triple) spaces to a single space.</p>
                <p>We have not coded line breaks, end-of-line hyphenation, visual rendition of
