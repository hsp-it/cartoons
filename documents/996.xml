                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

                <p>Cartoon depicts African American life both before and after the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation. An idealized version of African American life is featured in the illustration along with renderings of the depravities of slave life. A large center circle shows an African American family (mother, father, children, grandparents) in a home going about daily life. Below this center circle is a oval portrait of Abraham Lincoln. Flanking the main circle and Lincoln portrait is complex imagery showing of hardships facing African Americans during slavery and the benefits of freedom following the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>

                <p>Abraham Lincoln, sixteenth President of the United States, issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. The document declared "that all persons held as slaves" within the states in rebellion against the Union "henceforward shall be free." Though momentous, this document had many limitations and did not free any slaves in those slave-holding states which remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War.</p>
