        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>Cartoon depicts African American life both before and after the issuing of the
          Emancipation Proclamation. An idealized version of African American life is featured in
          the illustration along with renderings of the depravities of slave life. A large center
          circle shows an African American family (mother, father, children, grandparents) in a home
          going about daily life. Below this center circle is a oval portrait of Abraham Lincoln.
          Flanking the main circle and Lincoln portrait is complex imagery showing of hardships
          facing African Americans during slavery and the benefits of freedom following the
          Emancipation Proclamation.</p>

        <p>In the central scene of this cartoon is three generations of an African American family
          enjoying life post-emancipation. A woman cooks on a stove labeled "Union" while a man
          bounces a baby on his knee. A male and female child look on. There is also an older woman
          reading and a couple having a conversation in the background. Presiding over the scene is
          a framed portrait of Abraham Lincoln hanging next to a banjo on the wall.</p>

        <p>Abraham Lincoln, 16th president of the United States, issued the Emancipation
          Proclamation on January 1, 1863. The document declared "that all persons held as slaves"
          within the states in rebellion against the Union "henceforward shall be free." Though
          momentous, this document had many limitations and did not free any slaves in those
          slave-holding states that remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War.</p>

        <p>A personified rendering of Justice, holding olive branch and scales, reaches up to the
          depictions of freedom and emancipation. Behind her, two men in what appear to be Union
          army uniforms enthusiastically plant a flag.</p>

        <head>Homeownership</head>
        <p>One of the advantages of African-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation that
          Nast imagines is homeownership, here depicted as a man playing a banjo for a woman as they
          sit on the shores of an idyllic lake against the background of a peaceful town.</p>

      <div type="image_annotation" n="11" facs="#school">
        <head>Public School</head>
        <p>Another benefit of life after emancipation is shown in children gleefully leaving their
          mother at home and entering a building labeled Public School," over which the American
          flag flies.</p>

        <head>Payment for Labor</head>
        <p>A third benefit of a life free from slavery is earning a wage for work. This portion of
          the cartoon shows an African American man coming in from the cotton field and receiving
          his pay for a day's work at the cashier's window while others line up for their money
          behind him and a child looks on.</p>
