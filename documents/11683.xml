                            mostly through donations and purchases of individual prints. It also

                            Institute for Ethnic Studies. Some of the 20th century cartoons and
                            drawings were removed from the J. Hampton Moore papers (Collection
                            1541)."</acquisition>

                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

                <head>Western United States</head>
                <p>In the left-hand panel of the cartoon, captioned "What Pat would do with him," a
                    stereotypical depiction of an Irishman, wearing a top hat and smoking a pipe,
                    grabs a stereotypical depiction of a Chinese man by his topknot and tunic,
                    forcing him to stand on one foot. The Chinese man is grimacing. The two are
                    standing on a cliff overlooking the ocean. In the landscape behind them a
                    landmass labeled "China" can be viewed, likely indicating that this scene takes
                    place on the west coast of the United States, where many Chinese had immigrated
                    in the mid-1800s. It is implied that "Pat" (a stereotypically Irish name) wants
                    to throw "John Chinaman" off the cliff toward China.</p>

                    white man, implied to be a Southern plantation owner, wearing a wide-brimmed
                    hat, points with both hands as he guides a smiling Chinese man. The Chinese man
                    rests his hand on the Southerner's as he takes a large step forward. Behind
                    them, a sign with a large hand pointing from it advertises that cheap labor is
                    wanted in the cotton fields of the South. It is implied that the Chinese man
                    will perform the labor formerly done by slaves.</p>
