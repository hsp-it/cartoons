        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>In the left-hand panel of the cartoon, captioned "What Pat would do with him," an Irish
          or Irish-American man appears eager to throw a Chinese or Chinese-American man off a
          cliff. The Irishman is characterized by a top hat and pipe, the Chinese man by a topknot
          and tunic. In the landscape behind them a landmass labeled "China" can be viewed, likely
          indicating that this scene takes place on the west coast of the United States, where many
          Chinese had immigrated in the mid-1800s. In the right-hand panel, captioned "What will be
          done with him," a white man, implied to be a Southern plantation owner, guides the same
          Chinese or Chinese-American man to work in the cotton fields.</p>
        <p>In the Reconstruction Era, some white southern planters advocated replacing black slave
          labor with Chinese labor. A number of Chinese immigrants did work as sharecroppers, but
          they did not transform into the permanent underpaid workforce plantation owners hoped for.
          More generally, this cartoon comments on the increasing number of Chinese immigrants to
          the United States from the mid-19th century, especially following the Burlingame Treaty of
          1868, and rising anti-Chinese sentiment among European-American laborers, especially in
          California. This cartoon also provides early examples of the stereotypical depictions of
          Irish and Chinese people that would be seen again and again in American political cartoons
          of the late 19th century. </p>

        <p>In the left-hand panel of the cartoon, captioned "What Pat would do with him," a
          stereotypical depiction of an Irishman, wearing a top hat and smoking a pipe, grabs a
          stereotypical depiction of a Chinese man by his topknot and tunic, forcing him to stand on
          one foot. The Chinese man is grimacing. The two are standing on a cliff overlooking the
          ocean. In the landscape behind them a landmass labeled "China" can be viewed, likely
          indicating that this scene takes place on the west coast of the United States, where many
          Chinese had immigrated in the mid-1800s. It is implied that "Pat" (a stereotypically Irish
          name) wants to throw "John Chinaman" off the cliff toward China.</p>

          both hands as he guides a smiling Chinese man. The Chinese man rests his hand on the
          Southerner's as he takes a large step forward. Behind them, a sign with a large hand
          pointing from it advertises that cheap labor is wanted in the cotton fields of the South.
          It is implied that the Chinese man will perform the labor formerly done by slaves.</p>
