        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit that will
          demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and provide interpretive and contextual
          materials to encourage users to interact with historical images in new ways. This project
          was funded by a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's
          (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

        <p>The two women in this cartoon are clearly intended to be Victoria Woodhull and Tennessee
          Claflin, sisters who became the first female stock brokers. However, the artist does not
          provide any visual details to differentiate the two women and indicate which is Woodhull
          and which is Claflin. Both Claflin and Woodhull, in addition to being stock brokers and
          equal rights crusaders, worked as spiritualist mediums, clairvoyants (fortune tellers),
          and magnetic or faith healers; both were advisors to <persName key="ENT.000003634"
            >Cornelius Vanderbilt</persName>, who became their financial backer in establishing
          their brokerage firm. It may be that the woman actively "mesmerizing" Vanderbilt is

        <p>Cornelius ("Commodore") Vanderbilt made his fortune in the railroad business and in 1872,
          when this cartoon was published, was the richest man in America. His strong interest in
          spiritualism put him in touch with sisters <persName key="ENT.000002960">Victoria
            Woodhull</persName> and <persName key="ENT.000003633">Tennessee Claflin</persName>, who
          became his advisors. He provided silent financial backing for at least two historic
          firsts: the establishment of Woodhull and Claflin's brokerage firm, which made them the
          first women stock brokers, and Woodhull's presidential campaign, in which she became the
          first woman to run for president.</p>
