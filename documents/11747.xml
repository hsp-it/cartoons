                <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description
                    and discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and
                    promote the linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The
                    project will result in an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online
                    digital history exhibit that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
                    provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact
                    with historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the
                    National Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in
                    Archives and Documentary Editing program.</p>

                <p>At center, Cornelius Vanderbilt sits in a cushioned chair in a library. A woman,
                    identified in the caption as "First Lady Broker" (either Victoria Woodhull or
                    Tennessee Claflin) waves her hands in front of Vanderbilt's face, apparently
                    hypnotizing him. At Vanderbilt's side a second woman, identified in the caption
                    as "Second Lady Broker" (either Woodhull or Claflin), kneels and writes on a
                    piece of paper. The caption implies that Claflin and Woodhull have "mesmerized"
                    Vanderbilt in order to sell them shares of their stocks.</p>

                <p>The two women in this cartoon are clearly intended to be Victoria Woodhull and
                    Tennessee Claflin, sisters who became the first female stock brokers. However,
                    the artist does not provide any visual details to differentiate the two women
                    and indicate which is Woodhull and which is Claflin. Both Claflin and Woodhull,
                    in addition to being stock brokers and equal rights crusaders, worked as
                    spiritualist mediums, clairvoyants (fortune tellers), and magnetic or faith
                    healers; both were advisors to <persName key="ENT.000003634">Cornelius
                        Vanderbilt</persName>, who became their financial backer in establishing
                    their brokerage firm. It may be that the woman actively "mesmerizing" Vanderbilt
                    is supposed to be Claflin, as she was rumored to have had a romantic
                    relationship with him.</p>

                    or Woodhull. The cartoon implies that the two women are controlling Vanderbilt
                    to achieve financial gain.</p>

                <p>Cornelius ("Commodore") Vanderbilt made his fortune in the railroad business and
                    in 1872, when this cartoon was published, was the richest man in America. His
                    strong interest in spiritualism put him in touch with sisters <persName
                        key="ENT.000002960">Victoria Woodhull</persName> and <persName
                        key="ENT.000003633">Tennessee Claflin</persName>, who became his advisors.
                    He provided silent financial backing for at least two historic firsts: the
                    establishment of Woodhull and Claflin's brokerage firm, which made them the
                    first women stock brokers, and Woodhull's presidential campaign, in which she
                    became the first woman to run for president.</p>
