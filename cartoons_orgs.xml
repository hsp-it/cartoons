  <note type="org"><p>Founded by brothers Alexander and James Robertson in November 1771, the <hi rendition="#italics">Albany Gazette</hi> was the first newspaper published in the New York colony outside of New York City. The Robertson brothers printed the Gazette for less than a year, as difficulties obtaining supplies, distributing the paper, and a lack of subscriptions overwhelmed the small operation; their last issue was published in August 1772. The brothers began their publication ambivalent about the impending conflict for American independence and their paper was largely devoid of content relating to political tensions. The <hi rendition="#italics">Albany Gazette</hi> was resurrected after the Revolution in 1784 by another pair of brothers, Charles and George Webster. Under their direction, the <hi rendition="#italics">Albany Gazette</hi> largely matched the general New York political leanings toward Federalism, and they reprinted 12 of the 85 Federalist papers in 1788. The <hi rendition="#italics">Albany Gazette</hi> ceased printing in 1817.</p></note>

  <note type="org">The Second Bank of the United States was chartered by Congress in 1816 to perform essentially the same duties as the First Bank: to stabilize and unify the country’s economy. In its first eight years it was plagued by mismanagement, instability, and fraud. In 1823, Nicholas Biddle became president of the bank and gained control over a large portion of its functionality. However, Andrew Jackson was elected as President in 1828 on a largely anti-Bank platform, arguing that the Bank of the United States violated republican ideals. He vetoed the bank’s early charter renewal in 1832, and it expired in 1836; most of its funds were moved to state banks, although Biddle converted the bank to a state-chartered corporation in Pennsylvania just before its expiration. The bank was eventually totally liquidated in 1841.  The building of the Second Bank of the United States was designed by William Strickland, modeled on the Greek Parthenon. </note>

  <note type="org"><p>The <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Courier</hi> was the first daily newspaper printed in Boston, with its first issue published on March 2, 1824. The <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Courier</hi> was founded, published, and edited by prominent Boston conservative Joseph T.

The <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Courier</hi> was an early mouthpiece of the Whig Party and before that, the National Republicans; the paper spent a large portion of its early issues publishing pro-tariff editorial letters written by Buckingham. The newspaper was also notable for its “Geoponics” columns, published every Saturday, which gave readers useful information about farming practices and tools.  The columns were distinct for a paper based in a large city. </p>
                <p>Buckingham sold out his shares in the paper in 1848, and his sons, Joseph H. Buckingham and Edwin Buckingham, who had been involved with the editing and publishing the paper since 1831, also abandoned the project to their longtime partner E.B. Foster. The paper changed hands and political profiles several times in the years leading up to the Civil War, becoming a conservative weekly paper in 1871. </p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003600">Colored Orphan Asylum and Association for the Benefit of Colored Orphans (New York, N.Y.)</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Founded by three white Quaker women in 1836, the New York Colored Orphan’s Asylum housed destitute African American orphans. Founders Anna and Hanna Shotwell and Mary Murry purchased a small building at 12th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and began housing 11 black orphans rescued from almshouses. In 1843, the organization moved to larger house at 43rd and Fifth Avenue, which had a much larger capacity. </p>
              <p>  In the summer of 1863, New York City saw the largest armed insurrection outside of the Civil War: the New York Draft Riots. The riots were fueled by underlying racial and class tensions in the city, and broke out after Congress passed new laws allowing men to pay $300 to hire a replacement.  Beginning on July 13th a white, majority-Irish mob took to the streets and began burning buildings, smashing windows, and pulling up cobblestones in the streets. A mob seized the Orphan’s Asylum at around 4 PM, stealing everything of value, including donated infant's clothing, before setting the building ablaze. Overall in the draft riots that week, there were 120 deaths and 2000 people injured.</p>
                <p>All 233 children and in-house staff survived the attack, and the organization was forced to begin again on Randall’s Island (now Roosevelt Island), after all its assets were destroyed in the fire, an estimated loss of $80,000. The Asylum opened a new home in Harlem in 1867, and then relocated again to Riverdale, in the Bronx, in 1907. It continues to exist today as Harlem-Dowling Children’s Services. </p></note>

The publishers changed the paper’s name to <hi rendition="#italics">Columbian Centinel</hi> to reflect their project taking on more national news, rather than Massachusetts-specific content; the first issue under that title was published on June 16, 1790. The <hi rendition="#italics">Columbian Centinel</hi> was fiercely Federalist and feuded with its rival, the anti-Federalist Boston Chronicle from 1790 to 1793. The <hi rendition="#italics">Columbian Centinel</hi> had the largest subscription base of any newspaper in Boston in the years after the Revolution, and successfully reported on the Napoleonic Wars in Europe as well as national and local news. </p>
                <p>As Federalism dissolved with the election of James Monroe in 1816, the influence of the <hi rendition="#italics">Columbian Centinel</hi> waned. It merged with the <hi rendition="#italics">New England Palladium</hi> in 1830, and then again in 1836 with the <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Gazette</hi>.

  <note type="org"><p>Originally published by Noah Webster under the title <hi rendition="#italics">American Minerva</hi>, the paper began as the <hi rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> in September 1797 after a series of intermediate name changes.  Webster ceased his work with the paper in 1803, and Zachariah Lewis took over as publisher. Under its two first publishers the <hi rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> was strongly Federalist, and when Lewis sold the paper to William Stone (editor) and Francis Hall (publisher) in April 1820, it remained loyal to DeWitt Clinton and the Federalist project to construct the Erie Canal. With Stone and Hall, the paper became known for publishing cutting-edge literary works by Robert Charles Sands, Lucretia and Margaret Davidson, and other prominent poets. </p>
                   <p> In the election of 1828, the <hi rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> supported National Republican candidate John Quincy Adams, who lost to Andrew Jackson; even with a losing endorsement, the paper remained popular and moved to support the newly forming Whig Party. During these years, the <hi rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> also gained notoriety for publicly feuding with novelist James Fennimore Cooper; along with a number of other papers, Cooper sued the paper in 1840 for libel over reviews of his books <hi rendition="#italics">Home as Found</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">History of the Navy in the United States</hi>. Early in 1844, Stone left his editorship due to illness and died soon after; Francis Hall assumed his position.

  <note type="org"> <p>Perhaps the most famous and prolific lithography house, Currier and Ives was founded on Nassau Street in New York City in 1834 by Nathaniel Currier.  Currier operated this print shop, with its factory around the corner on Spruce Street, for 70 years.  Currier enlisted self-trained artist James Merritt Ives in 1857 to create images for the firm.  Under the new partnership, the business thrived; Currier and Ives innovated an assembly line-like factory floor, with a work flowing from artists, to lithographers, to letterers, to colorists in an efficient pattern.</p> 
                <p>By the time the firm closed in 1907, they had a working catalog of over 7,000 images in a variety of genres:  popular news illustrations, political cartoons, celebrity portraits, sentimental images of families, children, and animals, as well as some copies of famous paintings.  In the years after the Civil War, Currier and Ives also began printing “darktown comics,” cartoons depicting racist stereotypes of African-Americans. </p>
                <p>Business slowed for the firm at the turn of the 20th century, as costs dropped on photography and chromolithography, and hand-colored lithographs began to fall out of style. Currier and Ives had also suffered a myriad of personal tragedies over their careers and began to slow down. Just over a decade after the shop closed, after World War I, Currier and Ives prints came to be regarded as important pieces of Americana and became collectors’ items. </p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000000637">East India Company</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>Also known as the English or British East India Company or sometimes the “John Company,” the East India Company was founded on December 31, 1600 with a royal-charter from Elizabeth I.  The Honourable Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies had a virtual monopoly over English trade in the East. The organization was formally renamed in 1708 as the United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies (1708-1873).  In 1858 the crown disbanded the East India Company and the United Company of Merchants continued its trade without a royal charter until 1873.  The company was formed for the exploitation of trade routes with East and Southeast Asia and India. </p>
                
                <p>The East India Company’s contemporary competitors were the Dutch East India Company who dominated the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and the Portuguese who held influence in Japan and India. The Amboyna Massacre in 1623 marked the height of antagonism between the English and Dutch companies. Agents of the Dutch East India Company tortured and executed twenty men, ten of which were members of the English East India Company on the present-day island of Maluku, Indonesia. The aftermath of this incident barred the English from Indonesia and Japan. The company’s defeat of the Portuguese in India (1612) won them trading concessions from the Mughal Empire. They established trade in cotton, silk piece goods, indigo, and spices from South India. The company continued to expand into the Persian Gulf, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. After the mid-18th century the cotton-goods trade declined, while tea became an important import from China. Beginning in the early 19th-century, the company financed the tea trade with illegal opium exports to China. Chinese opposition to this trade resulted in the Opium War (1839-42). The Chinese were ultimately defeated and the British won additional trading privileges. </p>
                
                <p>The original company faced opposition to its monopoly, which led to the establishment of a rival company and the fusion (1708) of the two as the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies. The United Company was organized into a court of 24 directors who worked through committees. They were elected annually by the Court of Proprietors, or shareholders. When the company acquired control of Bengal in 1757, Indian policy was influenced by shareholders’ meetings, where votes could be bought by the purchase of shares. This led to government intervention. The Regulating Act (1773) and Pitt’s India Act (1784) established government control of political policy through a regulatory board responsible to Parliament. Thereafter, the company gradually lost both commercial and political control. Its commercial monopoly was broken in 1813, and from 1834 it was merely a managing agency for the British government of India. It ceased to exist as a legal entity in 1873.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>A satirical, 16-page, well illustrated humor magazine, Frank Leslie’s Budget of Fun (1855- was the second publication of successful New York newspaper publisher Frank Leslie (1821-1880). Sold for six-cents a copy, the Budget became extraordinarily popular, beating out its many previously existing competitors: <hi rendition="#italics">Yankee Notions</hi>, <hi rendition="#italics">Nick-Nax for All Creation</hi>, <hi rendition="#italics">Phunny Phellow</hi>, <hi rendition="#italics">New York Picayune</hi>, and <hi rendition="#italics">Comic Monthly</hi>. The paper was unabashedly political, unlike its competitors, with a strong democratic leaning like Leslie himself. The paper was generally suspicious of Lincoln, the Republican Party, and abolitionists. Once the Civil War began, the <hi rendition="#italics">Budget</hi> aligned with the North but continued to comment on the inefficiency of the Republican war effort and provided a skeptic’s opinion to the success of emancipation. However, after Gettysburg, the publication became significantly more supportive of Lincoln. <hi rendition="#italics">Budget’s</hi> audience began to dwindle in 1859 due to the success of the new weekly, <hi rendition="#italics">Vanity Fair</hi>.</p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003053">Frank Leslie's illustrated newspaper</orgName>
  <note type="org"> <p>Frank Leslie began his weekly illustrated newspaper in 1855, first edited by John Y. Foster. Printed on large quarto sized paper, each issue was 16 pages, and ran a mix of stories relating to war, politics, exploration, literature, and art, interspersed with detailed woodblock prints. As print and imaging technology progressed throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, <hi rendition="#italics">Leslie’s Illustrated</hi> began using daguerreotypes, and later, more advanced forms of photography for their illustrations. The paper became known for its images from the battlefields of the Civil War, and ran stories by prominent authors including Louisa May Alcott, Irving Hancock, Helen R. Martin, and Ellis Parker Butler. Its content was largely hawkish and patriotic, but was also followed for its coverage for other national events like the Klondike gold rush in 1897.</p> 
                <p>Leslie died in 1880, and his wife, Miriam Florence Leslie took over the paper. In 1902 she severed ties to <hi rendition="#italics">Leslie’s Illustrated</hi>, although it kept the Leslie name, as it was a long-established brand. <hi rendition="#italics">Leslie’s Illustrated</hi> cycled through a series of names, all variations on the original—it became <hi rendition="#italics">Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly</hi> in 1891, <hi rendition="#italics">Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly</hi> in 1894, <hi rendition="#italics">Leslie’s Weekly</hi> in 1901, back to <hi rendition="#italics">Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly</hi> in 1907, <hi rendition="#italics">Leslie's</hi> in 1912, <hi rendition="#italics">Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly Newspaper</hi> in 1914, and finally back to <hi rendition="#italics">Leslie's</hi> in 1920, before it ceased publication in 1922. </p></note>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003581">Journal of Commerce</orgName>
  <note type="org"> <p>First printed in September 1827, New York City’s <hi rendition="#italics">Journal of Commerce</hi> made its name intercepting incoming shipping vessels far off the shore in a schooner, taking note of their stock, and bringing the news to the harbor before it reached other papers so that merchants could prepare their bids. The <hi rendition="#italics">Journal of Commerce</hi> was founded by Arthur Tappan, a silk merchant and prominent abolitionist.  In 1840, Tappan turned control over the paper to Gereard Hallock and David Hale, editor and business manager respectively.</p> 
                <p>The <hi rendition="#italics">Journal of Commerce</hi> was unique in its coverage of the Amistad case in 1839, as Tappan was spearheading the revolters’ defense; the paper is largely credited with keeping the incident central to the national news media’s focus. In 1840, it merged with the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Gazette</hi> to gain stronger circulation base.</p>
                <p>Leading up to the Civil War, mirroring Hallock’s personal politics, the <hi rendition="#italics">Journal of Commerce</hi> advocated for the abolition of slavery by legal means, taking a strong anti-war and states’ rights stance. Many Republicans who had previously supported the paper were angered, and under the Lincoln administration in 1861, Hallock was indicted for publishing material supportive of the Confederacy; additionally the Postmaster General refused to distribute the paper by mail. In order to placate the federal government, Hallock retired, selling his shares in the paper to David M. Stone and William Cowper Prime. </p>
                <p>The paper faced financial difficulties as printing technologies changed rapidly after the Civil War and commerce and business news increasingly came from the new Western states and territories, rather than New York Harbor. But the paper persists into the 21st century having undergone a series of mergers, and is now published daily as an online subscription-only paper.</p> </note>

In 1866 the organization began as a social club for confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tennessee, and its aim was to reinstate white supremacy over the newly emancipated blacks.  Members of the Klan dressed in robes and sheets so that they wouldn’t be recognized by federal troops.  Klan members whipped and killed blacks during nighttime raids and helped reinstate white rule in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia between 1860 and 1870. After World War I the Klan emerged again, in reaction to a new wave of immigration and the migration of black Americans to northern cities. </p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>The Wide Awake Club was a nationwide grassroots paramilitary group that supported Abraham Lincoln’s1860 presidential campaign. The club was founded in Connecticut, and its members were mostly white men in their late teens or early twenties. The members wore black capes and soldier’s caps and carried torches during their frequent midnight marches. The club members addressed each other as soldiers and followed strict rules forbidding them to drink or smoke while in uniform.  Leaders of the club insisted that their organization would not promote violence, but many Democrats and southerners were particularly skeptical.  While most of the rallies were peaceful, some turned violent.  The club dissolved after Lincoln’s election in and many of its members were amongst the first to enlist as volunteers in the Union army.  Over eighty percent of the Hartford chapter served in War.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p> Anthony Imbert began a lithography company on Murray Street in New York City in 1825, and gained renown for producing the plates for <hi rendition="#italics">Memoir</hi>, a commemorative book by Cadwallader D. Colden celebrating the completion of the Erie Canal. The 35 plates in <hi rendition="#italics">Memoir</hi> showed a variety of new lithographic techniques, and the book’s text proclaimed Imbert’s relatively new lithography business “the most prominent in New York,” which was very likely an exaggeration. Imbert became well known as a lithographer of landscapes, and flourished as the Hudson River School style and interest in New York scenes grew.</p> 
               <p> Imbert began lithographing music scores in 1827, and caricatures and satirical images in 1828; between 1828 and his death in 1834 he issued 19 cartoons, more than double that of any other publisher in the country. He is credited with producing the first lithographed political cartoon in America, A New Map of the United States with the Additional Territories on an Improved Plan (1829).</p></note>

Noah traced their family lineage to the revolution, claiming that General Washington was present at his parents’ wedding in Philadelphia.  He considered himself an ardent patriot and Democrat, but he was also an eccentric.  Noah attempted to created a Jewish “refuge” called “Ararat” on the Grand Island located on the Niagara River in 1825, but received little support and the idea was ultimately abandoned.

  <note type="org"><p>Founded in Philadelphia by poet and printer Philip Freneau, the <hi rendition="#italics">National Gazette</hi> began publishing in October 1791. The paper was conceived of by Thomas Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican colleagues to combat the <hi rendition="#italics">Federalist Gazette</hi> of the United States. From the start, the paper was purely an organ of the Democratic - Republican Party; Freneau was a college friend of James Madison’s, and the paper was almost totally bankrolled by Jefferson. Additionally, George Washington and his administration, along with Alexander Hamilton, repeatedly accused of Jefferson dictating the paper’s content, although Freneau denied these allegations under oath. Madison himself wrote numerous essays published by the Gazette anonymously. The paper was virulent in attacking Adams and the Federalists, including Washington whenever he sided with Federalists in a debate, repeatedly accusing the party of Toryism, and warning of monarchical tendencies. Freneau went as far as to call Washington’s 61st birthday party “a forerunner of other monarchical vices.”  The <hi rendition="#italics">National Gazette</hi> informally ceased printing in October 1793, during the Yellow Fever epidemic in Philadelphia. A few months later, Jefferson resigned from his position as Washington’s Secretary of State, dissipating Freneau’s funding for the paper. </p> </note>

  <note type="org"><p>Following the <hi rendition="#italics">Independent Gazetteer</hi> of Philadelphia, the <hi rendition="#italics">National Intelligencer</hi> was founded in 1800, when the federal government moved from Philadelphia to Washington D.C. It was first owned by Samuel Harrison Smith, who was soon replaced by Joseph Gales and William Winston Seaton. Under Seaton and Gales, the Intelligencer became a stenographic paper, recording and publishing debates taking place on the floor of Congress and the House of Representatives. The paper remained popular through the Madison administration, but its offices were partially destroyed during the British occupation of Washington in the War of 1812; however, this only spurred the paper on to more patriotic popularity.</p>
                <p> The <hi rendition="#italics">Intelligencer</hi> operated as the organ of all of the federal administrations until Andrew Jackson’s election in 1828, when it sided with the Whig party, and featured essays and columns written by the strongest voices of the opposition: Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and even John Calhoun, Jackson’s Vice President.  However, as a partisan paper, the <hi rendition="#italics">Intelligencer</hi> steadily declined in popularity; it was debt-ridden by the end of the Civil War, and was bought by Alexander del Mar in 1869.

  <note type="org"><p>The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi> formed in 1829 with the merger of James Watson Webb’s <hi rendition="#italics">New York Morning Courier</hi> and the <hi rendition="#italics">New-York Enquirer</hi>, edited by Mordecai Noah. Webb assumed editorship over the new paper, and after hiring associate editor James Gordon Bennett, it became an early mouthpiece of the Democratic Party. The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi> gained fame in 1830 for setting up a pony express system to bring memos from Washington D.C. to the New York City newspapers. </p>
                <p>However, as Jacksonian populism lost steam with the growing business class in New York, the paper began to support Henry Clay’s burgeoning National Republicanism. Webb and the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi> were founding tenets of the new party, and the paper became one of the most powerful in the country. As part of the party machine, it sparked ferocious debate in the U.S. House of Representatives in its 1837-1838 sessions: Kentucky congressman William J. Graves challenged a Maine Democratic congressman, Jonathan Cilley, to a duel after Cilly criticized the Courier and Enquirer on the House floor. It ended with Graves shooting Cilley to death. </p>
                <p>The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi> went into decline with the Whig party, as the country moved towards greater unrest. The paper, which had always supported slavery, fell out of favor as many New Yorkers and other Northerners began to become more earnestly interested in abolition.

  <orgName key="ENT.000003541">New York Herald</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p> The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Herald</hi> was first published on May 6th 1835, by James Gordon Bennett Sr., a former schoolteacher and Scottish immigrant. After years as a journalist in New York City, he rose to become the assistant editor of the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">Enquirer</hi> in 1823, and then quickly founded his own paper. The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Herald</hi> became known for its salacious subject matter, which some critics found to be lowbrow; Bennett himself asserted that the paper’s mission was “not to instruct but to startle.” The paper was sold at a lower price than its competitors, and was edited to be consumed by the general public. It became the highest circulated and most profitable paper in the country. </p>
                <p>Bennett’s <hi rendition="#italics">Herald</hi>, was pioneering in several areas, running the first newspaper interview ever, which was in conjunction with the <hi rendition="#italics">Herald</hi>’s high-profile coverage of the murder of Helen Jewett. He also conducted the first ever exclusive interview with a US President—Martin Van Buren. Additionally, Bennett was the first to use the industry standard of taking cash from advertisers in advance, rather than waiting for their adverts to run. </p>
                <p>Bennett’s politics were essentially conservative—he was a Democrat and anti-abolitionist, anti-Catholic, and anti-immigrant. The paper remained supportive of the Democratic Party throughout the Civil War, but backed the Union cause.</p> 
                <p>In 1866, Bennett’s son, James Gordon Bennett Jr., assumed control of the paper. Bennett Jr. used the <hi rendition="#italics">Herald</hi> to finance several high-profile trans-continental explorations, including Henry Morton Stanley’s expeditions to Africa in 1871, and George W. DeLong’s expedition to the arctic. He also infamously ran the New York Zoo hoax in 1874, in which almost an entire day’s paper was devoted to a wholly fabricated story about wild animals escaping from the Central Park Zoo and goring several people. Fine print at the end of the issue stated that the story was a fiction, and Bennett tried to assuage critics by arguing that the issue was meant to highlight inadequate safety precautions at the zoo. </p>
                <p>The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Herald</hi> acquired its smaller rival, the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Tribune</hi>, after Bennett Jr.’s death in 1924, and published as the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Herald-Tribune</hi>.

  <note type="org"><p>The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Times</hi> was founded in 1851 by Henry Jarvis Raymond and was a penny newspaper. Its original title was the <hi rendition="#italics">New-York Daily Times</hi>.  Its first editors decided to appeal to a cultured and intellectual readership rather than appealing to mass audiences. Consequently, the newspaper’s early years were troubled, as many readers found its tone off-putting and unapproachable. The newspaper increased its circulation in the 1870s when it published a series on William Tweed, the boss of Tammany Hall.  The paper exposed his corruption, published evidence of his criminal behavior, and, consequently, helped put an end to Tammany Hall.  When Adolph Simon Ochs, publisher of the Chattanooga Times, bought the paper in 1896, it was losing $1000 a week.  Ochs transformed the publication into an internationally respected daily and invented the paper’s slogan “All the news that’s fit to print.”  </p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>This prominent Pennsylvania newspaper was first published on Christmas Eve 1728 by Samuel Keimer as <hi rendition="#italics">The Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences: and Pennsylvania Gazette</hi>. Keimer’s original intent was to print a page of <hi rendition="#italics">Ephraim Chambers’ Cyclopaedia</hi>, or <hi rendition="#italics">Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences</hi> in every issue; however, after nine months of printing he had less than 100 subscribers. On October 2, 1729, Benjamin Franklin and Hugh Meredith bought the paper and shortened the name to the Pennsylvania Gazette. Franklin and Meredith gained a reputation and a large subscriber base, and after Franklin was appointed postmaster, the paper overtook Bradford’s Mercury for the largest circulation in Philadelphia. </p>

  <note type="org"> <p>The <hi rendition="#italics">Philadelphia Inquirer</hi> is the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the United States and has won 19 Pulitzer Prizes.  It was founded by John R. Walker and John Norvell in June 1829 as The Pennsylvania Inquirer.

                <p>During the Civil War, the newspaper increased circulation to over 70,000 and was popular amongst Union and Confederate soldiers.  In 1863, the <hi rendition="#italics">Inquirer</hi> became one of the first American newspapers to use a web-fed rotary press which allowed for printing on both sides of the paper at once.  In the 1880s circulation decreased and in 1889 the <hi rendition="#italics">Inquirer</hi> was sold to James Elverson who increased staff and employed the latest technological advances in printing.  James Elverson, Jr. inherited the newspaper after his father’s death in 1911.

  <note type="org"><p><hi rendition="#italics">Puck</hi> was a successful American humor magazine.  The staff was comprised of several of the nation’s most talented cartoonists, including Berhard Gillam, Frederick Opper, C.J Taylor, and, its founder, Joseph Keppler.  It was also the first American magazine to publish weekly color lithographs.</p>         
                <p>In 1876 Joseph Keppler and Adolf Schwarzmann founded <hi rendition="#italics">Puck</hi>, as a German language humor magazine.  They published the first English language version of the magazine in March 1877.  <hi rendition="#italics">Puck</hi> was named after a Shakespearian character from Midsummer Night’s Dream.  The magazine’s motto, “what fools these mortals be,” and its symbol, a chubby putto wearing a top hat, were printed on the cover of every edition.  A typical issue included a full-color political cartoon on the front cover, a double-page centerfold, several black-and-white cartoons, and editorials addressing contemporary issues. <hi rendition="#italics">Puck</hi>’s political cartoons poked fun at politicians such as Ulysses Grant, James Blaine, William Taft, and Theodore Roosevelt, and explored topics such as immigration and political corruption. The magazine printed a hugely popular “tattooed man” series which poked fun at 1884 presidential candidate James Blaine.  Blaine was so enraged about the cartoons that he considered suing the editors of Puck for libel.</p>               
                <p>Schwarzmann took over full ownership of the magazine after Keppler’s death in 1894.  In 1914 Nathan Straus Jr. bought the magazine. Puck  was bought by the William Randolph Hearst company in 1916. The final edition was distributed on September 5, 1918. </p>

  <orgName key="ENT.000003323">Punch, or the London Charivari</orgName>
  <note type="org"><p>One of the most famous and long-running satirical magazines of all time, <hi rendition="#italics">Punch</hi> was founded in London by Ebenezer Landells and Henry Mayhew in 1841. Early on, the magazine modeled itself on the French paper <hi rendition="#italics">Le Charivari</hi>, and with the desire to be less bitter and more literary than contemporary British humor magazines. <hi rendition="#italics">Punch</hi> initially struggled with subscriptions, until it began to publish with the prominent Bradbury and Evans house. At the start of its heyday, it was a politically radical, supporting labor and critical of the upper class. But as the 1860s progressed, it earned its conservative reputation by keeping consistent with the values of the rising middle class and expanding British Empire under Queen Victoria. </p>
                <p><hi rendition="#italics">Punch</hi> employed the most prominent British cartoonists of the day, including Leech, Keene, du Maurier, and Tenniel, and the staff developed a particular culture and method of producing the magazine. Perhaps the most famous aspect of the staff culture was the “Punch Table”—a large oblong table at which the staff would eat decadent lunches, drink wine, and smoke cigars. Only after the meal was thoroughly enjoyed did the editor convene the meeting by yelling out, “Gentleman, the cartoon!” Artists would then begin pitching their ideas.</p> 
                <p><hi rendition="#italics">Punch</hi> is credited with coining the word “cartoon” itself, in 1843.</p>
                <p>Circulation was at its highest in 1940 with 175,000 subscribers. <hi rendition="#italics">Punch</hi> only began to stagnate in the 1970s, with circulation dropping to desperate levels in the ‘80s. It closed in 1992, and came to a brief revival from 1996-2002, but was eventually closed again due to a poor subscription base. </p></note>

Standard Oil controlled most of the oil production, refinery, and transport in the United States from 1870 to 1911.</p>                  
                    <p>In 1863 Rockefeller formed a business partnership with Maurice B. Clark and Samuel Andrews and established an oil refining business in Cleveland, Ohio. In ten years Standard Oil eliminated most of its competitors in Ohio and the Northeastern United States. By 1880, Standard Oil Company controlled most of the oil refinery in the United States.  Rockefeller created the Standard Oil Trust in 1882.  In 1892 the Ohio Supreme Court ordered the Trust dissolved.  However, the court order was impossible to enforce and the Trust continued to operate. In 1899, their New Jersey firm was renamed the Standard Oil Company and became dedicated as a holding company. It assumed the assets and interests formerly held by the Trust.  In May 1911, the US Supreme Court declared Standard Oil in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Law and dissolved the company. Despite the Supreme Court's decision, Rockefeller continued to amass a fortune and is considered one of the wealthiest men in US history.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p>Considered the more obscure, west-coast equivalent to <hi rendition="#italics">Puck</hi> magazine, the <hi rendition="#italics">San Francisco Illustrated Wasp</hi> also offered richly detailed political cartoons and caricatures for California readers. The <hi rendition="#italics">Wasp</hi> was distinctive for its full-page folio-sized illustrations and large centerfolds, which were very costly to produce. As a result of these high-printing costs, the magazine was often financially unstable and ownership changed regularly. It was founded in 1876 by Francis Korbel, a successful bohemian cigar maker and lithographer. The <hi rendition="#italics">Wasp’s</hi> original success was largely due to Korbel’s lithographer George Frederick Keller. Keller was one of Korbel’s cigar box lithographers who had previous experience working on the “virulently anti-Catholic” humor magazine, <hi rendition="#italics">The Jolly Giant</hi>. Keller’s richly detailed oversized illustrations helped the <hi rendition="#italics">Wasp</hi> become California’s premiere satire and humor magazine.  Ambrose Bierce served as editor of from 1881 to 1885.  It eventually ceased publication on April 25, 1941.</p></note>

  <note type="org"><p><hi rendition="#italics">The New York World</hi> was a daily newspaper published in New York City from 1860 to 1931. The <hi rendition="#italics">World</hi> was originally available as a penny paper that supported President Abraham Lincoln’s action in the American Civil War.   Circulation of the New York World dramatically increased after Joseph Pulitzer purchased it in 1883.  When William Randolph Hearst bought the competing <hi>New York Journal</hi> in 1895, he convinced many of Pulitzer’s Sunday newspaper staff to join the <hi rendition="#italics">Journal</hi>.  Rivalry between the William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer sparked an era of publicity stunts and yellow journalism.  In 1931 the World was combined with the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Evening Telegram</hi> (founded 1867) to become the <hi rendition="#italics">New York World-Telegram</hi>.
