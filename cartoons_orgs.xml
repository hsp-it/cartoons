        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit, featuring
          500 encoded political cartoons, that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
          provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact with
          historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the National
          Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and
          Documentary Editing program.</p>

            <note type="org"><p>Founded by brothers Alexander and James Robertson in November 1771,
                the <hi rendition="#italics">Albany Gazette</hi> was the first newspaper published
                in the New York colony outside of New York City. The Robertson brothers printed the
                Gazette for less than a year, as difficulties obtaining supplies, distributing the
                paper, and a lack of subscriptions overwhelmed the small operation; their last issue
                was published in August 1772. The brothers began their publication ambivalent about
                the impending conflict for American independence and their paper was largely devoid
                of content relating to political tensions. The <hi rendition="#italics">Albany
                  Gazette</hi> was resurrected after the Revolution in 1784 by another pair of
                brothers, Charles and George Webster. Under their direction, the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Albany Gazette</hi> largely matched the general New York
                political leanings toward Federalism, and they reprinted 12 of the 85 Federalist
                papers in 1788. The <hi rendition="#italics">Albany Gazette</hi> ceased printing in
                1817.</p></note>

            <orgName key="ENT.000003575">Boston Courier</orgName>
            <note type="org"><p>The <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Courier</hi> was the first daily
                newspaper printed in Boston, with its first issue published on March 2, 1824. The
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Courier</hi> was founded, published, and edited by
                prominent Boston conservative Joseph T. Buckingham, who had gained notoriety for
                publishing the New England Galaxy and Masonic Magazine. The <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >Boston Courier</hi> was an early mouthpiece of the Whig Party and before that,
                the National Republicans; the paper spent a large portion of its early issues
                publishing pro-tariff editorial letters written by Buckingham. The newspaper was
                also notable for its “Geoponics” columns, published every Saturday, which gave
                readers useful information about farming practices and tools. The columns were
                distinct for a paper based in a large city. </p>
              <p>Buckingham sold out his shares in the paper in 1848, and his sons, Joseph H.
                Buckingham and Edwin Buckingham, who had been involved with the editing and
                publishing the paper since 1831, also abandoned the project to their longtime
                partner E.B. Foster. The paper changed hands and political profiles several times in
                the years leading up to the Civil War, becoming a conservative weekly paper in 1871.

            <note type="org"><p>The <hi rendition="#italics">Columbian Centinel</hi> was a
                continuation of the <hi rendition="#italics">Massachusetts Centinel</hi> and the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Republican Journal</hi>, first published by Benjamin Russell
                and William Warden in Boston, 1784. The publishers changed the paper’s name to <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Columbian Centinel</hi> to reflect their project taking on
                more national news, rather than Massachusetts-specific content; the first issue
                under that title was published on June 16, 1790. The <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >Columbian Centinel</hi> was fiercely Federalist and feuded with its rival, the
                anti-Federalist Boston Chronicle from 1790 to 1793. The <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >Columbian Centinel</hi> had the largest subscription base of any newspaper in
                Boston in the years after the Revolution, and successfully reported on the
                Napoleonic Wars in Europe as well as national and local news. </p>
              <p>As Federalism dissolved with the election of James Monroe in 1816, the influence of
                the <hi rendition="#italics">Columbian Centinel</hi> waned. It merged with the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">New England Palladium</hi> in 1830, and then again in 1836
                with the <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Gazette</hi>. It was finally bought out by
                the <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Daily Advertiser</hi> in 1840. </p>

            <orgName key="ENT.000003570">Commercial Advertiser</orgName>
            <note type="org"><p>Originally published by Noah Webster under the title <hi
                  rendition="#italics">American Minerva</hi>, the paper began as the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> in September 1797 after a series
                of intermediate name changes. Webster ceased his work with the paper in 1803, and
                Zachariah Lewis took over as publisher. Under its two first publishers the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> was strongly Federalist, and when
                Lewis sold the paper to William Stone (editor) and Francis Hall (publisher) in April
                1820, it remained loyal to DeWitt Clinton and the Federalist project to construct
                the Eerie Canal. With Stone and Hall, the paper became known for publishing
                cutting-edge literary works by Robert Charles Sands, Lucretia and Margaret Davidson,
                and other prominent poets. </p>
              <p> In the election of 1828, the <hi rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi>
                supported National Republican candidate John Quincy Adams, who lost to Andrew
                Jackson; even with a losing endorsement, the paper remained popular and moved to
                support the newly forming Whig Party. During these years, the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> also gained notoriety for publicly
                feuding with novelist James Fennimore Cooper; along with a number of other papers,
                Cooper sued the paper in 1840 for libel over reviews of his books <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Home as Found</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">History of
                  the Navy in the United States</hi>. Early in 1844, Stone left his editorship due
                to illness and died soon after; Francis Hall assumed his position. Leadership of the
                paper changed hands several times over the next decades, until the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> was rebranded in 1904 as <hi
                  rendition="#italics">The Globe and Commercial Advertiser</hi>, popularly known as
                the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Globe</hi>. In 1923, Frank Munsey bought the
                paper and merged it with the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Sun</hi>. </p>

            <note type="org"><p>The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi>
                formed in 1829 with the merger of James Watson Webb’s <hi rendition="#italics">New
                  York Morning Courier</hi> and the <hi rendition="#italics">New-York Enquirer</hi>,
                edited by Mordecai Noah. Webb assumed editorship over the new paper, and after
                hiring associate editor James Gordon Bennett, it became an early mouthpiece of the
                Democratic Party. The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi>
                gained notoriety in 1830 for setting up a pony express system to bring memos from
                Washington D.C. to the New York City newspapers. </p>
              <p>However, as Jacksonian populism lost steam with the growing business class in New
                York, the paper began to support Henry Clay’s burgeoning National Republicanism.
                Webb and the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi> were
                founding tenets of the new party, and the paper became one of the most powerful in
                the country. As part of the party machine, it sparked ferocious debate in the U.S.
                House of Representatives in its 1837-1838 sessions: Kentucky congressman William J.
                Graves challenged a Maine Democratic congressman, Jonathan Cilley, to a duel after
                Cilly criticized the Courier and Enquirer on the House floor. It ended with Graves
                shooting Cilley to death. </p>
              <p>The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi> went into decline
                with the Whig party, as the country moved towards greater unrest. The paper, which
                had always supported slavery, fell out of favor as many New Yorkers and other
                Northerners began to become more earnestly interested in abolition. With the
                election of President Lincoln in 1861 and the onset of the Civil War, the paper
                merged with the <hi rendition="#italics">New York World</hi>. </p></note>
