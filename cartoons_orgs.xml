        <p>The Historic Images, New Technologies (HINT) project aims to enhance description and
          discovery of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's graphics materials and promote the
          linking and sharing of content among institutions and scholars. The project will result in
          an update to HSP's digital image viewer and an online digital history exhibit, featuring
          500 encoded political cartoons, that will demonstrate the new viewer's capabilities and
          provide interpretive and contextual materials to encourage users to interact with
          historical images in new ways. This project was funded by a grant from the National
          Historical Publications and Records Commission's (NHPRC) Innovation in Archives and
          Documentary Editing program.</p>

            <note type="org"><p>Founded by brothers Alexander and James Robertson in November 1771,
                the <hi rendition="#italics">Albany Gazette</hi> was the first newspaper published
                in the New York colony outside of New York City. The Robertson brothers printed the
                Gazette for less than a year, as difficulties obtaining supplies, distributing the
                paper, and a lack of subscriptions overwhelmed the small operation; their last issue
                was published in August 1772. The brothers began their publication ambivalent about
                the impending conflict for American independence and their paper was largely devoid
                of content relating to political tensions. The <hi rendition="#italics">Albany
                  Gazette</hi> was resurrected after the Revolution in 1784 by another pair of
                brothers, Charles and George Webster. Under their direction, the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Albany Gazette</hi> largely matched the general New York
                political leanings toward Federalism, and they reprinted 12 of the 85 Federalist
                papers in 1788. The <hi rendition="#italics">Albany Gazette</hi> ceased printing in
                1817.</p></note>

            <note type="org"> The Second Bank of the United States was chartered by Congress in1816
              to perform essentially the same duties as the First Bank: to stabilize and unify the
              country’s economy. In its first eight years it was plagued by mismanagement,
              instability, and fraud. In 1823, Nicholas Biddle became the President of the Bank and
              gained control over a large portion of its functionality. However, Andrew Jackson was
              elected as President in 1828 on a largely anti-Bank platform, arguing that the Bank of
              the United States violated republican ideals. He vetoed the Bank’s early charter
              renewal in 1832, and it expired in 1836; most of its funds were moved to state banks,
              although Biddle converted the Bank to a state-chartered corporation in Pennsylvania
              just before its expiration. The Bank was eventually totally liquidated in 1841. The
              building of the Second Bank of the United States was designed by William Strickland,
              modeled on the Greek Parthenon. </note>

            <orgName key="ENT.000003575">Boston Courier</orgName>
            <note type="org"><p>The <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Courier</hi> was the first daily
                newspaper printed in Boston, with its first issue published on March 2, 1824. The
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Courier</hi> was founded, published, and edited by
                prominent Boston conservative Joseph T. Buckingham, who had gained notoriety for
                publishing the New England Galaxy and Masonic Magazine. The <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >Boston Courier</hi> was an early mouthpiece of the Whig Party and before that,
                the National Republicans; the paper spent a large portion of its early issues
                publishing pro-tariff editorial letters written by Buckingham. The newspaper was
                also notable for its “Geoponics” columns, published every Saturday, which gave
                readers useful information about farming practices and tools. The columns were
                distinct for a paper based in a large city. </p>
              <p>Buckingham sold out his shares in the paper in 1848, and his sons, Joseph H.
                Buckingham and Edwin Buckingham, who had been involved with the editing and
                publishing the paper since 1831, also abandoned the project to their longtime
                partner E.B. Foster. The paper changed hands and political profiles several times in
                the years leading up to the Civil War, becoming a conservative weekly paper in 1871.

                  rendition="#italics">Republican Journal</hi>, first published by Benjamin Russell
                and William Warden in Boston, 1784. The publishers changed the paper’s name to <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Columbian Centinel</hi> to reflect their project taking on
                more national news, rather than Massachusetts-specific content; the first issue
                under that title was published on June 16, 1790. The <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >Columbian Centinel</hi> was fiercely Federalist and feuded with its rival, the
                anti-Federalist Boston Chronicle from 1790 to 1793. The <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >Columbian Centinel</hi> had the largest subscription base of any newspaper in
                Boston in the years after the Revolution, and successfully reported on the
                Napoleonic Wars in Europe as well as national and local news. </p>
              <p>As Federalism dissolved with the election of James Monroe in 1816, the influence of
                the <hi rendition="#italics">Columbian Centinel</hi> waned. It merged with the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">New England Palladium</hi> in 1830, and then again in 1836
                with the <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Gazette</hi>. It was finally bought out by
                the <hi rendition="#italics">Boston Daily Advertiser</hi> in 1840. </p>

            <note type="org"><p>Originally published by Noah Webster under the title <hi
                  rendition="#italics">American Minerva</hi>, the paper began as the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> in September 1797 after a series
                of intermediate name changes. Webster ceased his work with the paper in 1803, and
                Zachariah Lewis took over as publisher. Under its two first publishers the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> was strongly Federalist, and when
                Lewis sold the paper to William Stone (editor) and Francis Hall (publisher) in April
                1820, it remained loyal to DeWitt Clinton and the Federalist project to construct
                the Erie Canal. With Stone and Hall, the paper became known for publishing
                cutting-edge literary works by Robert Charles Sands, Lucretia and Margaret Davidson,
                and other prominent poets. </p>
              <p> In the election of 1828, the <hi rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi>
                supported National Republican candidate John Quincy Adams, who lost to Andrew
                Jackson; even with a losing endorsement, the paper remained popular and moved to
                support the newly forming Whig Party. During these years, the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> also gained notoriety for publicly
                feuding with novelist James Fennimore Cooper; along with a number of other papers,
                Cooper sued the paper in 1840 for libel over reviews of his books <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Home as Found</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">History of
                  the Navy in the United States</hi>. Early in 1844, Stone left his editorship due
                to illness and died soon after; Francis Hall assumed his position. Leadership of the
                paper changed hands several times over the next decades, until the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Commercial Advertiser</hi> was rebranded in 1904 as <hi
                  rendition="#italics">The Globe and Commercial Advertiser</hi>, popularly known as
                the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Globe</hi>. In 1923, Frank Munsey bought the

            <note type="org"><p>Founded by Mordecai Manuel Noah in September 1833, the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Evening Star</hi> was published in New York until August
                1840. Noah invited Thomas Gill, previously the business manager for <hi

                  rendition="#italics">Evening Star</hi>. Founded after Noah had a serious falling
                out with his once-ally President Jackson, the paper was an early promoter of Whig
                politics. It endorsed William Henry Harrison for President in 1836 through his loss
                to Martin Van Buren, and again in 1840, likely heavily influencing the outcome for
                Harrison in New York.</p>
              <p>Just after the 1840 elections, Gill passed away, and Noah was left unequipped to
                handle the paper’s business alone. He sold it to the Commercial Advertiser in late
                1840. </p></note>

            <note type="org">
              <p>First printed in September 1827, New York City’s <hi rendition="#italics">Journal
                  of Commerce</hi> made its name intercepting incoming shipping vessels far off the
                shore in a schooner, taking note of their stock, and bringing the news to the harbor
                before it reached other papers so that merchants could prepare their bids. The <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Journal of Commerce</hi> was founded by Arthur Tappan, a silk
                merchant and prominent abolitionist. In 1840, Tappan turned control over the paper
                to Gereard Hallock and David Hale, editor and business manager respectively.</p>
              <p>The <hi rendition="#italics">Journal of Commerce</hi> was unique in its coverage of
                the Amistad case in 1839, as Tappan was spearheading the revolters’ defense; the
                paper is largely credited with keeping the incident central to the national news
                media’s focus. In 1840, it merged with the <hi rendition="#italics">New York
                  Gazette</hi> to gain stronger circulation base.</p>
              <p>Leading up to the Civil War, mirroring Hallock’s personal politics, the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Journal of Commerce</hi> advocated for the abolition of
                slavery by legal means, taking a strong anti-war and states’ rights stance. Many
                Republicans who had previously supported the paper were angered, and under the
                Lincoln administration in 1861, Hallock was indicted for publishing material
                supportive of the Confederacy; additionally the Postmaster General refused to
                distribute the paper by mail. In order to placate the federal government, Hallock
                retired, selling his shares in the paper to David M. Stone and William Cowper Prime. </p>
              <p>The paper faced financial difficulties as printing technologies changed rapidly
                after the Civil War and commerce and business news increasingly came from the new
                Western states and territories, rather than New York Harbor. But the paper persists
                into the 21st century having undergone a series of mergers, and is now published
                daily as an online subscription-only paper.</p>

            <note type="org"><p> Anthony Imbert began a lithography company on Murray Street in New
                York City in 1825, and gained notoriety for producing the plates for <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Memoir</hi>, a commemorative book by Cadwallader D. Colden
                celebrating the completion of the Erie Canal. The 35 plates in <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Memoir</hi> showed a variety of new lithographic techniques,
                and the book’s text proclaimed Imbert’s relatively new lithography business “the
                most prominent in New York,” which was very likely an exaggeration. Imbert gained
                notoriety as a lithographer of landscapes, and flourished as the Hudson River School
                style and interest in New York scenes gained notoriety.</p>
              <p> Imbert began lithographing music scores in 1827, and caricatures and satirical
                images in 1828; between 1828 and his death in 1834 he issued 19 cartoons, more than
                double that of any other publisher in the country. </p></note>

            <note type="org"><p>The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi>
                formed in 1829 with the merger of James Watson Webb’s <hi rendition="#italics">New
                  York Morning Courier</hi> and the <hi rendition="#italics">New-York Enquirer</hi>,
                edited by Mordecai Noah. Webb assumed editorship over the new paper, and after
                hiring associate editor James Gordon Bennett, it became an early mouthpiece of the
                Democratic Party. The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi>
                gained fame in 1830 for setting up a pony express system to bring memos from
                Washington D.C. to the New York City newspapers. </p>
              <p>However, as Jacksonian populism lost steam with the growing business class in New
                York, the paper began to support Henry Clay’s burgeoning National Republicanism.
                Webb and the <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi> were
                founding tenets of the new party, and the paper became one of the most powerful in
                the country. As part of the party machine, it sparked ferocious debate in the U.S.
                House of Representatives in its 1837-1838 sessions: Kentucky congressman William J.
                Graves challenged a Maine Democratic congressman, Jonathan Cilley, to a duel after
                Cilly criticized the Courier and Enquirer on the House floor. It ended with Graves
                shooting Cilley to death. </p>
              <p>The <hi rendition="#italics">New York Courier and Enquirer</hi> went into decline
                with the Whig party, as the country moved towards greater unrest. The paper, which
                had always supported slavery, fell out of favor as many New Yorkers and other
                Northerners began to become more earnestly interested in abolition. With the
                election of President Lincoln in 1861 and the onset of the Civil War, the paper
                merged with the <hi rendition="#italics">New York World</hi>. </p></note>

            <orgName key="ENT.000001300">Pennsylvania Gazette</orgName>
            <note type="org"><p>This prominent Pennsylvania newspaper was first published on
                Christmas Eve 1728 by Samuel Keimer as <hi rendition="#italics">The Universal
                  Instructor in all Arts and Sciences: and Pennsylvania Gazette</hi>. Keimer’s
                original intent was to print a page of <hi rendition="#italics">Ephraim Chambers’
                  Cyclopaedia</hi>, or <hi rendition="#italics">Universal Dictionary of Arts and
                  Sciences</hi> in every issue; however, after nine months of printing he had less
                than 100 subscribers. On October 2, 1729, Benjamin Franklin and Hugh Meredith bought
                the paper and shortened the name to the Pennsylvania Gazette. Franklin and Meredith
                gained a reputation and a large subscriber base, and after Franklin was appointed
                postmaster, the paper overtook Bradford’s Mercury for the largest circulation in
                Philadelphia. </p>
              <p>The partners separated in 1732, and Franklin began to publish the paper once a week
                rather than bi-weekly. The <hi rendition="#italics">Pennsylvania Gazette</hi>
                published the first American political cartoon on May 9, 1754, with the iconic Join
                or Die image of a snake cut into pieces, referencing the colonies need to unite in
                the face of European power in the midst of the Seven Years War. The paper remained
                prominent in Philadelphia and is best known for its coverage of the precluding
                sentiment to the American Revolution, as well as its reporting on the war itself.
                The <hi rendition="#italics">Pennsylvania Gazette</hi> ceased publication in 1800,
                ten years after Franklin’s death.</p></note>
